Here is what you should do if you have an issue or even a question (this list is ordered from fastest to slowest resolution time):

1. **Read this documentation.**  
   We strive to keep it up-to-date and cover all possible issues and questions. Use the search bar to quickly find what you're looking for.

2. **Reach out through the chat widget.**  
   Users subscribed to the `Hobby` or `Professional` plan can directly reach out via the chat widget located in the bottom-right corner of the app.

> **Note**: We are developing an AI-powered Agent Dialog that will be able to answer most questions. It's not ready yet but is coming soon.
