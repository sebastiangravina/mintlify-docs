## Steps to Enable RTL

1. Navigate to the **Theme** tab in your Agent settings.
2. Paste the following Custom CSS into the designated Custom CSS field:

   ```css
   .agent-container {
     direction: rtl;
   }

   .agent-avatar-container {
     margin-right: 0;
     margin-left: 0.5rem;
   }

   .guest-container {
     margin-left: 0;
     margin-right: 50px;
   }
   ```

3. Exit the CSS box to apply the new styling.

 <Frame style={{ maxWidth: '600px' }}>
  <img src="/images/guides/rtl.gif" alt="Custom CSS RTL" />
</Frame>

> **Note**: Adjust margins or padding values as needed to ensure proper alignment based on your layout preferences.

### Validation and Testing
Before deployment:
- Confirm that text aligns properly in right-to-left format.
- Verify that margins and paddings are consistent across all elements.
- Test on different devices to ensure responsiveness.
