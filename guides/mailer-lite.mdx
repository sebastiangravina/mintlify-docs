title: Add a Subscriber to MailerLite
---

## Steps to Add a Subscriber to MailerLite

### 1. Collect the User's Email
- Add a step to your workflow that collects the **user's email**.
- Store the collected email in a variable named, for example, `{{user.email}}`.

```json
{
  "trigger": "Collect User Email",
  "userInput": {
    "type": "email",
    "label": "Enter your email address",
    "variableName": "user.email"
  }
}
```

### 2. Add a Webhook Step
- Insert a **Webhook step** after the email is collected.

### 3. Configure the Webhook Step
Set up the Webhook step with the following information:

#### Webhook Configuration:
- **Method**: `POST`
- **URL**: `https://connect.mailerlite.com/api/subscribers`
- **Headers**: Add the following headers:
  - `Content-Type`: `application/json`
  - `Authorization`: `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN` *(replace `YOUR_TOKEN` with your MailerLite API key)*
- **Body**: Configure the body as JSON with the email variable and any additional fields you want to include.

```json
{
  "email": "{{user.email}}",
  "fields": {
    "name": "{{user.name}}"
  }
}
```

#### Example Setup:
```json
{
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "https://connect.mailerlite.com/api/subscribers",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
  },
  "body": {
    "email": "{{user.email}}",
    "fields": {
      "name": "{{user.name}}"
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note**: You can find your API key in the [MailerLite API settings](https://app.mailerlite.com/integrations/api/).

### 4. Preview in Iframe
Ensure that the workflow is set up correctly, and test it using an iframe preview.

#### Iframe Example:
To preview, integrate an iframe in your testing environment. Example configuration:

```html
<iframe
  src="https://your-app-preview-url"
  width="100%"
  height="600px"
  frameborder="0"
  allowFullScreen
></iframe>
```

### 5. Additional Fields
For more information on what fields you can add, refer to the MailerLite documentation: [List All Fields](https://developers.mailerlite.com/docs/fields.html#list-all-fields).

### Validation and Testing
Before deployment, verify the following:
- Ensure the **email collection step** saves the email correctly into the `{{user.email}}` variable.
- Validate that the Webhook request sends data accurately to MailerLite.
- Test the iframe preview to confirm it displays as expected.

> **Tip**: Use [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/) to validate your JSON structure.
