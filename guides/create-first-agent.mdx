title: How to Create Your First Agent
---

You can create your first agent in just a few minutes. This guide will walk you through the process step by step.

## Create a New Agent
**Log in to your Release0 account**.
**Click on the "Create Agent" button** in the dashboard. You will be working within your default [workspace](/workspace/general)
There are 3 ways to create an agent:
- **Use a template**: Choose from a variety of pre-built templates to kickstart your agent.
- **Build from scratch**: Start with a blank canvas and build your agent from the ground up.
- **Import Agent**: Import an existing agent from another workspace or account.

We will focus on creating an agent from scratch.
### 1. Select "Build from scratch"
When you select the **Build from scratch** option, you'll be taken to the flow editor where you can start building your agent from a blank canvas. You can add blocks, customize the flow, and configure settings as needed.

En the left side on your screen, you will see the **Blocks** panel. This is where you can add different types of blocks to your agent flow. You can choose from a variety of blocks, including:
- **Text**: Send a message to the user.
- **Input**: Collect user input (text, number, email, etc.).
- **Logic**: Create conditions and branches in your flow.
- **Integrations**: Connect to third-party services like Google Sheets, Zapier, Stripe, etc.
- **AI**: Integrate advanced AI models like OpenAI, Claude, Mistral, Groq, etc.

### 2. Add a Text Block
To start, drag and drop a **Text Block** from the **Blocks** panel to the flow editor. This block will be the first message your agent sends to the user.


### 3. Configure the Text Block
Click on the **Text Block** you just added to open its configuration panel. Here, you can customize the message that will be sent to the user. For example, you can set the message to "Hello! How can I help you today?".

### 4. Add a User Input Block
User input blocks are essential for collecting information from users. After the text block, you can add an input block to ask the user for their name or any other information you need.
Next, drag and drop an **Text** Input Block from the **Blocks** panel to the flow editor. This block will allow the user to enter their name.
### 5. Configure the Input Block
Click on the **Text** Input Block you just added to open its configuration panel. Here, you can customize the input and assign a [variable](/editor/variables) such as 'name' and set a label for the input.

### 6. Read the User Input
You can use the variable you assigned to the input block to read the user's response. For example, you can use the variable `name` to greet the user by their name in the next text block.

### 7. Test Your Agent
Once you have added the text and input blocks, you can test your agent by clicking on the **Play** button in the top right corner of the flow editor. This will open a preview of your agent where you can interact with it and see how it responds to user input.
