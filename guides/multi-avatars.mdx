## Dynamic Avatars Implementation

You can configure the **host avatar** to change dynamically, allowing your bot to display multiple avatars depending on the context or flow. Follow this guide for a simple implementation.

### Example: Multiple Avatars Demo

1. Navigate to the **Theme** tab in your settings.
2. Set the **host avatar** to a variable URL.

   ```plaintext
   Variable URL agent
   ```

3. Use your flow to dynamically assign a URL to the variable, updating the host avatar during the conversation.

### Flow Example: Multiple Avatars

Below is an example flow demonstrating dynamic avatar changes.

#### Flow Structure

1. **First Block**: Defines all the avatar URLs that can be used.
2. **Second Block**: Starts the flow by assigning the avatar to the robot's avatar.
3. **Final Block**: Updates the avatar to the cat's avatar.

#### Example Configuration

```json
{
  "flow": [
    {
      "block": "Avatar Setup",
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "setVariable",
          "key": "avatarUrl",
          "value": "https://example.com/robot-avatar.png"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "block": "Wizard Avatar",
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "setVariable",
          "key": "avatarUrl",
          "value": "https://example.com/robot-avatar.png"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "block": "Swordsmith Avatar",
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "setVariable",
          "key": "avatarUrl",
          "value": "https://example.com/cat-avatar.png"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Validation and Testing

Before deploying the dynamic avatars feature, ensure:

- All variable URLs are reachable and return the desired images.
- Transitions between avatars occur seamlessly in the flow.
- The avatar changes are tested across various devices and browsers.

> **Note**: Use placeholder images during development and replace them with final URLs before deployment.
