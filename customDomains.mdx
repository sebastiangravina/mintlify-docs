description: Discover how to use custom domains for your Release0 agents to enhance brand recognition. This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up custom domains, including using Release0's free domain or your own, and configuring SSL certificates for secure connections.
---


Whenever you're creating an Agent for marketing purposes, support or lead generation, it is important to use a custom domain for better brand recognition.

At **Release0** we offer our own domain **'release0.ar'** for your agents for free. 

However, you can also use your own custom domain for your agents. Check out our [pricing page](https://release0.com/pricing) for details about custom domain limits per plan.

###  Premium Short Domain Now Available

Starting with the **Business plan and above**, you can now publish your Release0 agents using the premium short domain: `r0.ar`

This feature unlocks:
- A **clean and professional** URL for your agents
- **Shorter, more memorable** links (e.g., `https://r0.ar/your-slug/agent`)
- **Simplified QR codes** for easier scanning and better aesthetics
- Improved branding and shareability across platforms

> **Available from Pro plan onwards** â€” no additional setup needed.

## SSL Certificates

- When you use **our provided domains**, we automatically **generate and manage SSL certificates for you**. This means that your agents will always be served over HTTPS, ensuring a secure connection for your users.
- When you bring **your own custom domain**, we also automatically **generate and manage SSL certificates for you**. This means that your agents will always be served over HTTPS, ensuring a secure connection for your users.
- We use **Let's Encrypt** as our certificate authority to issue these SSL certificates.
- **Certificate generation may take a few minutes**, especially right after connecting a custom domain. Please allow some time for the setup to complete.

## Prerequisites

1. A Release0 Workspace. If you don't have one, you can create one for free.
2. A custom domain that you own. If you don't have one, you can purchase one from a domain registrar like [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/), [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/), or [Google Squarespace](https://domains.squarespace.com/).
3. Access to your domain registrar's DNS settings.


## Step 1 Add a Custom Domain

1. Go to the **Settings** menu in your workspace.
2. Click on **Domains**.

<Frame style={{ maxWidth: '600px' }}>
  <img src="/images/workspace/domains/add-domain.png" alt="Release0.com - Add new domain" />
</Frame>
3. Click on **Add Domain** button

<Frame style={{ maxWidth: '600px' }}>
  <img src="/images/workspace/domains/domain-name.png" alt="Release0.com - Add domain name" />
</Frame>

4. Enter your custom domain name in the *Your domain** field and click **Add Domain**.

> **Note:** If you are bringing your own custom domain, your agent link do not use a **[workspace slug](/workspace/general#workspace-slug)**. The slug is only used for the domains provided by Release0 (e.g. `release0.ar/your-slug/agent`).

## Step 2 Configure your domain

After adding your domain, you will see a new domain in the entry list, click on the config gear and you'll be presented with a DNS record that you'll need to add to your domain's DNS settings.

<Frame style={{ maxWidth: '800px' }}>
  <img src="/images/workspace/domains/dns-settings.png" alt="Release0.com - DNS settings" />
</Frame>

Use the information provided to add a new A record or CNAME record to your domain registrar's DNS settings. The CNAME record should point to the provided value.

## Step 2a: Adding an Apex Domain

If you're adding an apex domain (e.g. `example.com`), you'll need to add an **A record** with the following values:

```plaintext
Name: @ (or leave it blank)
Value: 76.76.21.21
TTL: 86400 (or the highest value possible)
```

## Step 2b: Adding a Subdomain

If you're adding a subdomain (e.g. `my-agent.mycompany.com`), you'll need to add a **CNAME record** with the following values:

```plaintext
Name: my-agent (or whatever subdomain you want to use)
Value: cname.r0.ar
TTL: 86400 (or the highest value possible)
```

> **Note:** We do not support using `www.` as a subdomain, since the `www.` subdomain will always redirect to the apex domain instead.

## How long do I have to wait for my domain to work?
Domain configuration can take anywhere between 1 to 24 hours to complete. If your domain still doesn't work after 24 hours, please [reach out to us](https://agent.r0.ar/support) and we'll be happy to help you out.

### Recommended Subdomain Variations

We recommend using the following variations for your subdomains:

- `agent.example.com`
- `support.example.com`
- `nps.example.com`
- `salesbot.example.com`
