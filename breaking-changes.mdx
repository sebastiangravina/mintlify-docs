## Release0 v6

- **List Variables**: These no longer automatically display the last item when inserted into an *Agent Dialog*. This behavior was deemed too "magical." You can now use the inline code feature to retrieve the last element of a list explicitly:

  ```plaintext
  {{={{List var}}.at(-1)=}}
  ```

  Refer to the updated [Inline Variable Formatting Section](/editor/variables) for more details.

- **User Input Prefill**: Prefill is now disabled by default. If needed, you can enable it in the [Settings](/settings/overview/) tab of your Agent.

- **Dialogue Option**: The `Message Sequence` option in the OpenAI block has been removed for similar reasonsâ€”it was overly "magical." Instead, a new `Dialogue` option has been introduced. For more information:
