### Agent URL

Your agent’s public URL is made up of two parts:

1. **Domain** – The base domain under which your agent will be published.  
2. **Agent Slug** – A customizable path segment that uniquely identifies your agent.

> Example URLs:
> 
> - `https://r0.ar/your-workspace-slug/nps-agent`  
> - `https://release0.ar/your-team/support-agent`  
> - `https://chat.mybrand.com/support-bot`  
> - `https://bot.mycompany.ai/assistant`

To generate a valid public URL, the agent must be [**published**](/editor/publish). Unpublished agents cannot be accessed via their public link.

### Custom Domains

If you're using a **custom domain**, your agent URL will be cleaner and more direct — it won't include your workspace slug.

> **Note**: The **workspace slug is only required** when using Release0-managed domains like `r0.ar` or `release0.ar`.

#### Example URLs

- **Using a custom domain (no workspace slug):**  
  `https://chat.acme.com/faq-agent`  
  `https://support.yourbrand.ai/sales-bot`  
  `https://agents.mycompany.com/helpdesk`

- **Using a Release0 domain (with workspace slug):**  
  `https://r0.ar/my-workspace/my-agent`  
  `https://release0.ar/team-alpha/feedback-bot`

To use your own domain, see the [Custom Domains](/workspace/customDomains) documentation for full setup instructions.

### Agent Name

- The display name for your agent.
- This is visible to users and in the agent link preview.
- There are no strict limits, but short, descriptive names work best.

---

### Agent Icon

- The icon that represents your agent.
- You can choose from a set of emojis, upload a custom image, or paste a URL.
- The icon is shown in the agent list and in link previews.
- Recommended image size: **512x512px** (square).

To change it, click the current icon and select a new one from the emoji picker, or upload/link an image.

### Tags

- Add relevant tags to help categorize your agent.
- Tags are useful for organizing agents and filtering them in dashboards.
- Example: `Support`, `AI Assistant`, `Chatbot`

<Frame style={{ maxWidth: '600px' }}>
  <img src="/images/agent-settings/agent-tags.png" alt="Release0.com - Agent tags" />
</Frame>

For more information on how to use tags, please refer to the [Tags](/workspace/tags) documentation.

### Description

- A short description of your agent.
- Used in link previews, agent list, and internal dashboards.
- Example: *"A smart customer support agent for handling inquiries."*

---

### Save and Publish

- **Save**: Stores your configuration changes without making the agent public.
- **Publish**: Deploys the agent and makes it publicly accessible with the current settings.

> **Note**: Always review your settings before publishing.  
> URL changes after publishing may break existing links.
