The **Unpublish** option allows you to remove the agent from public access. This is useful when you want to make changes or updates to the agent without it being accessible to users.

When you unpublish an agent, it will no longer be available at its public URL. However, you can still access it in the editor for further modifications.

To unpublish an agent, follow these steps:
1. Open the agent settings in the editor.
2. Click on the **Unpublish** button.
    <Frame style={{ maxWidth: '400px' }}>
    <img src="/images/agent-settings/agent-unpublish.png" alt="Release0.com - Agent unpublish" />
    </Frame>
3. Confirm the action when prompted.
    <Frame style={{ maxWidth: '400px' }}>
    <img src="/images/agent-settings/agent-unpublish-confirm.png" alt="Release0.com - Agent unpublish confirm" />
    </Frame>
4. The agent will be unpublished and will no longer be accessible via its public URL.
