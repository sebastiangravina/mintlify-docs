# What is an Agent in Release0?

In **Release0**, an **Agent** represents a fully customizable, automated chatbot or interactive form. It's the primary unit used to engage users through conversational workflows and automation.

## How to Create an Agent
1. **Navigate to the Agents section** in your Release0 wortkspace.
2. **Click on the "Create Agent" button** to start a new agent.

There are 3 ways to create an agent:
- **Use a template**: Choose from a variety of pre-built templates to kickstart your agent.
- **Build from scratch**: Start with a blank canvas and build your agent from the ground up.
- **Import Agent**: Import an existing agent from another workspace or account.

### Creating an Agent from Template

When you select the **Use a template** option, you'll be presented with a list of available templates organized in categories. You can browse through the templates and select one that fits your needs.
When browsing through the templates, you can see a preview of each template, including its name, description, and a thumbnail image. You can also see the template agent preview in the right panel to get a better idea of how it will look and function.

### Building an Agent from Scratch
When you select the **Build from scratch** option, you'll be taken to the flow editor where you can start building your agent from a blank canvas. You can add blocks, customize the flow, and configure settings as needed.

### Importing an Agent
When you select the **Import Agent** option, you'll be prompted to select the file of the agent you want to import. This can be an agent from another workspace or account. Once you select the agent file, click on the **Open** button to start the process. Then you'll be taken to the flow editor where you can review and edit the imported agent.
