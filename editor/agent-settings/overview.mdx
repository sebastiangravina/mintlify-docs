## How to Create an Agent
1. **Navigate to the Agents section** in your Release0 workspace.
2. **Click on the "Create Agent" button** to start a new agent.

There are 3 ways to create an agent:
- **Use a template**: Choose from a variety of pre-built templates to kickstart your agent.
- **Build from scratch**: Start with a blank canvas and build your agent from the ground up.
- **Import an agent**: Bring in an existing agent from another workspace or account.

### Creating an Agent from Template

When you select the **Use a template** option, you'll be presented with a list of available templates organized in categories. You can browse the categorized templates, preview their name, description, and thumbnail image, and select the one that best fits your needs. You can also see the template agent preview in the right panel to get a better idea of how it will look and function.

### Building an Agent from Scratch
When you select the **Build from scratch** option, you'll be taken to the [flow editor](/editor/graph) where you can start building your agent from a blank canvas. You can add [elements](/editor/elements/overview), customize the flow, and configure settings as needed.

### Importing an Agent
Choosing the **Import an agent** option lets you select a file containing an existing agent from another workspace or account. Once you select the agent file, click on the **Open** button to start the process. Then you'll be taken to the flow editor where you can review and edit the imported agent.
