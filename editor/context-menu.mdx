Triggering a **context menu** in a builder interface, allows users to perform specific actions by right-clicking on different elements (groups, blocks, or edges). Here's a concise breakdown:

1. **Right-Click on a Group**:
   - **Duplicate**: Creates a copy of the group with identical blocks and settings.
   - **Delete**: Removes the entire group.

2. **Right-Click on a Block**:
   - **Duplicate**: Creates a copy of the block with identical settings, placing it directly below the original.
   - **Delete**: Removes the block.

3. **Right-Click on an Edge**:
   - **Delete**: Removes the edge.
