# Elements

Elements serve as the **fundamental components of an Agent dialog**. You can link multiple elements together to construct intricate conversation flows. When adding a element to the Agent flow via drag and drop, it is automatically placed within a group, which can be assigned a title. Every element is contained within a group.

To simplify the process of selecting the appropriate element, they are categorized into different types:
