## Key Features

- **Embed Websites and Videos**:  
  Paste a URL (e.g., YouTube, Vimeo, mp4, or other embeddable content).  
  Note: Some websites may not allow embedding. If you see a blank space, the website likely prohibits embedding.

- **Embed PDFs from Google Drive**:  
  Select the PDF file on Google Drive.  
  Right-click > **Preview** > **More actions** > **Open in a new window**.  
  Click **More actions** > **Embed item**.  
  Copy the embed code and paste it into the Embed Agent Dialog element configuration.

- **Wait for Event**:  
  Use this option if you own the website being embedded and want to continue the agent flow only after a specific event is dispatched from the embedded content.
  To send an event from the embedded website to the bot:

```javascript
window.parent.postMessage(
  { name: 'My event', data: 'Custom data passed to the Agent variable' },
  '*'
);
```
You can define the name of the event, it needs to match what you’ve set in the Embed Agent Dialog element configuration.
