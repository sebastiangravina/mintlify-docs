### Supported Video Services

When you paste a video URL, the system automatically detects the service and adjusts the iframe settings. Supported platforms include:

- **YouTube** (videos and shorts)
- **Vimeo**
- **TikTok**
- **Gumlet**
- **OneDrive**

### Missing Services

If the video platform is not supported, you can use the **[Embed content](./embed)** Agent Dialog element and paste the iframe code manually.

### Limitation: YouTube Clips

YouTube clips are not supported because the platform cannot automatically transform the clip URL into an embeddable format. To embed a YouTube clip:

1. Go to YouTube and click **Share > Embed**.
2. Copy the iframe code.
3. Use the **Embed Agent Dialog element** to paste the iframe code.


### Adding a Video with a URL

1. Copy the video URL from a supported platform.
2. Paste it into the Video Agent Dialog element.
3. The system will handle the embedding automatically.

### Adding a Video with the Embed Agent Dialog element (for unsupported services)

1. Obtain the iframe embed code from the video platform.
2. Add an  **[Embed content](./embed)** Agent Dialog element.
3. Paste the iframe code directly into the element.
