# Blocks

Blocks serve as the **fundamental components of an Agent dialog**. You can link multiple blocks together to construct intricate conversation flows. When adding a block to the Agent flow via drag and drop, it is automatically placed within a group, which can be assigned a title. Every block is contained within a group.

To simplify the process of selecting the appropriate block, they are categorized into different types:
