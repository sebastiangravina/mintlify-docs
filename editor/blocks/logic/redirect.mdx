## Important Notes
> **Note**: On Safari and iOS devices, redirects to a new tab are blocked by default. In such cases, a popup will be displayed to the user instead. 

### Testing Recommendations
- Ensure you test the **URL Redirect** logic block on Safari and iOS devices to verify functionality.
- Confirm the desired behavior (current tab or new tab) works as intended across various browsers.
