- **Consent management** workflows

### üåç **Localization and Personalization**
- **Language detection** combined with region
- **Cultural adaptation** of communication style
- **Regional content** and product availability
- **Local support** routing and business hours

### Example: Smart EU Detection Flow

```
[Get Location Info: Map "Is EU Country" to {{is_eu_user}}]

Condition: {{is_eu_user}} equals true

EU User Experience:
"üá™üá∫ Welcome! We've automatically enabled GDPR protection.
‚Ä¢ Your data is anonymized
‚Ä¢ Cookies require consent  
‚Ä¢ Prices include VAT
‚Ä¢ You have full data rights

Non-EU User Experience:
"üåç Welcome! Enjoy our full-featured experience.
‚Ä¢ Complete analytics enabled
‚Ä¢ Personalization active
‚Ä¢ Streamlined checkout
‚Ä¢ Enhanced recommendations

Ready to get started? [Yes] [Customize Privacy]"
```

<Warning>
**Critical Implementation Note**: Always use the **Is EU Country** flag as your primary decision point for GDPR compliance, not individual country checks. This ensures you catch all 27 EU member states automatically, including any future additions.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

### Privacy and Compliance

1. **Automatic Protection**: The block automatically protects EU users - no additional configuration needed
2. **Consent Management**: Use raw data options only with proper legal basis
3. **Data Minimization**: Collect only the data you actually need
4. **Transparency**: Always inform users about data collection

### Performance Optimization

1. **Selective Collection**: Use only the actions you need (network, location, device, browser)
2. **Variable Mapping**: Map only necessary variables to avoid bloat
3. **Conditional Logic**: Use collected data to optimize user experience

### Error Handling

1. **Graceful Degradation**: Ensure your flow works even if user info collection fails
2. **Fallback Content**: Provide default experiences when data is unavailable
3. **Validation**: Verify collected data before using in critical logic

## Privacy Considerations

### For EU Users (Automatic)
- IP addresses are automatically anonymized (last octet removed)
- IP geolocation coordinates are reduced to ~1km precision
- Referer URLs are truncated to origin only
- User agents have detailed version info removed

### For All Users
- Device and browser information is considered low-risk
- Country and city data are generally safe
- Host information poses no privacy risks

### Raw Data Usage
- Use "(Raw)" variables only with proper consent
- Ensure compliance with local privacy laws
- Document your legal basis for raw data collection

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No Data Collected**: Ensure at least one variable is mapped in response mapping
2. **Empty Variables**: Check that the action is placed after user interaction starts
3. **GDPR Conflicts**: Verify you have consent before using raw data options
4. **Location Inaccuracy**: Remember that EU coordinates have reduced precision and are IP-based (not GPS)

### Debugging Tips

1. **Test Both EU and Non-EU**: Use VPN to test different regional behaviors
2. **Check Browser Console**: Network requests may provide additional debugging info
3. **Validate Mappings**: Ensure variable names match exactly in your flows
4. **Monitor Privacy Flags**: Use "Is EU Country" to understand protection status

## Data Structure Reference

### Network Data Format
```javascript
{
  ip: "192.168.1.0",           // Anonymized for EU
  ipRaw: "192.168.1.123",      // Original IP
  referer: "https://example.com", // Origin only for EU
  refererRaw: "https://example.com/path?param=value",
  userAgent: "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT; Win64; x64) Chrome",
  userAgentRaw: "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) Chrome/120.0.0.0",
  host: "yoursite.com"
}
```

### Location Data Format
```javascript
{
  country: "United States",
  city: "New York",
  continent: "North America",
  region: "New York",
  latitude: 40.71,            // Reduced precision for EU (IP-based)
  longitude: -74.01,          // Reduced precision for EU (IP-based)
  latitudeRaw: 40.7128,       // Original precision (IP-based)
  longitudeRaw: -74.0060,     // Original precision (IP-based)
  isEuCountry: false
}
```

<Info>
**Location Accuracy**: Coordinates are derived from IP geolocation, which typically provides city-level accuracy (1-10km range) depending on ISP and infrastructure. This is not GPS data from the user's device.
</Info>

### Device Data Format
```javascript
{
  type: "mobile",
  vendor: "Apple",
  model: "iPhone"
}
```

### Browser Data Format
```javascript
{
  name: "Chrome",
  version: "120.0.0.0",
  language: {
    full: "en-US",
    code: "en",
    region: "US"
  },
  os: {
    name: "iOS",
    version: "17.1.0"
  }
}
```

With these configurations, your Release0 agent can collect comprehensive user information while maintaining privacy compliance and providing personalized experiences across different devices, locations, and user preferences.

## Important Limitations

### IP Geolocation vs GPS
- **What it is**: Location data derived from IP address geolocation
- **What it's not**: GPS coordinates from user's device
- **Accuracy**: City-level accuracy (1-10km range), varies by ISP
- **Source**: Vercel's geolocation headers based on IP infrastructure

### Data Availability
- Location data depends on Vercel's geolocation service
- Some corporate networks or VPNs may provide inaccurate location data
- Mobile networks may show ISP location rather than user's actual location
- Coordinates may be null for some IP ranges
