The **Agent Link** Logic Block allows you to seamlessly transition from one Agent dialog flow to another. This feature ensures that your workflows remain clean, modular, and reusable in various contexts.

The **agents answers** are saved in the **Submission** tab of the original Agent, allowing you to access all collected data in one place.

For example if Agent A links to Agent B, the answers collected in Agent B will be saved in the **Submission** tab of Agent A.

>**Note**: When creating complex workflows, consider using the **Jump to agent** Logic Block to link Agents together. This helps maintain a clear structure and allows for easy management of multiple Agents.

## Key Features

### Share Variables Between Agents

The **Jump to agent** Logic Block automatically shares variable values between linked Agents. If the linked Agent contains variables with the same names, they are pre-filled with the values collected from the first Agent.

- **Example**:
  1. The first Agent asks the user for their name and stores it in the variable `Name`.
  2. The linked Agent displays the `Name` variable in a response.
  - **Outcome**: The user's name collected in the first Agent is displayed in the second Agent dialog.

- Sending all collected data to a third-party app in a single request.
- Compiling responses into a unified results table.

- **Example**:
  1. The first Agent collects basic information (e.g., name, email).
  2. The linked Agent gathers additional details (e.g., preferences, feedback).
  3. All answers are combined and processed as a single dataset.
