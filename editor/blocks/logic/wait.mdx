The **Delay** block allows you to pause the conversation for a set number of seconds. This feature can be used to:

- **Emphasize key points** by pausing after a message.
- **Ensure clarity** by giving users time to read before redirection or interaction.
- **Enhance flow timing** in cases where immediate transitions may feel abrupt.

## Features of the **Delay** Block

### 1. **Duration**
- You can specify the duration (in seconds) for the pause.
- Example:
  - Short pauses (1–2 seconds): To make interactions feel natural.
  - Longer pauses (3–5 seconds): To give users time to process important messages.

### 2. **Pause the Flow**
- Enabling **Pause the Flow** prevents agent from processing subsequent blocks until the pause ends.
- Use this option when:
  - You want to **delay** executing long-running actions.
  - You need to **control the display** of multiple messages before moving to the next action.


## When to Use the **Delay** Block

### Appropriate Use Cases
- **Highlighting Key Messages**: Pause after delivering a crucial message to ensure it is read.
- **Before Redirection**: Add a delay before redirecting users to an external URL or action.
- **For Visual Effects**: Create natural conversation pacing in dialogue-heavy flows.

### Misuses to Avoid
- **Excessive Pauses**: Long or frequent pauses can frustrate users and disrupt the experience.
- **General Typing Speed Control**: Adjust this through **[Typing Emulation Settings](/theme/overview)**, not the **Delay** block.

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Pauses Brief**: Limit pauses to under 5 seconds to maintain engagement.
2. **Test User Experience**: Simulate interactions to ensure pauses enhance, rather than hinder, flow.
3. **Combine with **[Typing Emulation Settings](/theme/overview)**: Use together for natural pacing in dialogues.
