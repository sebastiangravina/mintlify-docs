The **Mistral AI** block enables seamless interaction with Mistral's AI models, allowing users to create chat completions based on their queries and display responses in the *Agent Dialog*.

## Creating a Mistral Account

To get started with Mistral AI:
1. Visit [Mistral Console](https://console.mistral.ai).
2. Create an account and log in.

## Chat Completion with Mistral AI

Using the Mistral AI block, you can generate chat completions based on user queries. The integration supports the **Dialogue** message type, which allows the assistant to maintain a conversation history for a smooth and contextualized interaction.

### Steps to Use Mistral AI for Chat Completion

1. **Set Up the Integration**:
   - Access the Mistral AI block within your project.
   - Configure the block by adding your Mistral API key.

2. **Prepare User Inputs**:
   - Collect user messages and organize them in a sequence.
   - Ensure a proper format for passing the conversation history.

3. **Generate Responses**:
   - Send the prepared dialogue sequence to the Mistral API.
   - Display the response in the *Agent Dialog*.

4. **Test the Integration**:
   - Verify that user queries receive appropriate and timely responses.

### Example Configuration

Below is an example JSON payload to interact with Mistral's chat completion API:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    { "role": "user", "content": "Hello, how can you help me?" },
    { "role": "assistant", "content": "I can assist with various tasks. What do you need help with?" }
  ],
  "model": "mistral-7b-v0.1",
  "temperature": 0.7
}
```

### Notes on Dialogue Message Type

- Dialogue allows passing a sequence of saved messages between the user and assistant.
- Ensure the conversation history is structured in a chronological format.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### HTTP 401 Error
If you encounter an HTTP 401 error when loading Mistral models:
- Your API key might not be fully propagated.
- Wait a few minutes and try again.

## Validation and Testing

Before deploying the Mistral AI integration:
- Verify the API key is correctly set.
