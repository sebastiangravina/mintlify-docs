title: How to use the HTTP Request block in Release0 to connect with external APIs and fetch or send data
description: Send and receive data from external APIs using HTTP requests in your chatbot agent. Learn how to configure HTTP requests, handle responses, and display dynamic content in your agent dialogs. 
---
## What is an HTTP Request?
An **HTTP Request** allows your chatbot to communicate with external services or APIs to fetch or send data. It is a standardized way to interact with web-based services by specifying:
- A **URL** (endpoint) to request data from.
- A **method** (e.g., GET or POST) to determine the nature of the request.
- Additional parameters, headers, or a body if required by the API.


In this example, we will use an HTTP `GET` request to retrieve movie details from the OMDB API based on a movie title provided by the user.


## Steps to Implement

### 1. Collect User Input
Create a dialog to collect the movie name from the user.

#### Example Setup:
- **Prompt Text:** "Search for a movie"
- **Variable Name:** `Movie`

### 2. Configure HTTP Request to Fetch Data
Use the HTTP request block to call the OMDB API and retrieve movie details.

#### HTTP Request Configuration:
- **URL:**  
  Replace `{{Movie}}` with the variable containing the user input:  
  ```
  http://www.omdbapi.com/?t={{Movie}}&apikey=YOUR_API_KEY
  ```
- **Method:** `GET`

#### Testing the Request:
1. **Set Variable Test Value:**  
   - Variable: `Movie`  
   - Test Value: `Indiana Jones`
2. Click **Test the Request** to ensure the API call is functioning correctly.  
   Example Response:  
   ```json
   {
     "Title": "Indiana Jones",
     "Year": "1981",
     "Poster": "https://image.url/indiana-jones.jpg"
   }
   ```

### 3. Save API Response to Variables
Map the relevant JSON keys from the API response to variables for use in subsequent steps.

| API Response Key | Variable Name |
|-------------------|---------------|
| `data.Title`      | `Title`       |
| `data.Year`       | `Year`        |
| `data.Poster`     | `Poster`      |

#### Example Configuration:
- **Data:** `data.Title`  
  **Set Variable:** `Title`  
- **Data:** `data.Year`  
  **Set Variable:** `Year`  
- **Data:** `data.Poster`  
  **Set Variable:** `Poster`

---

### 4. Display the Results Dynamically
Create a dialog bubble to display the fetched movie details.

#### Dynamic Content Setup:
- **Agent dialog:**  
  ```
  Found: {{Title}} ({{Year}})
  ```
- **Agent image dialogle:**  
  Set the image source to `{{Poster}}`.

---

### 5. Optional: Call a Webhook
You can integrate services like Make.com or Zapier for further processing by sending the collected data to a webhook URL.

#### Webhook Configuration:
- **Webhook URL:** Enter the provided URL (e.g., `https://hook.eu1.make.com/...`).  
- **Custom Payload Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "movie": "{{Title}}",
    "year": "{{Year}}",
    "poster": "{{Poster}}"
  }
  ```

#### Testing the Webhook:
1. Click **Test the Request** to ensure the data is sent successfully.
2. Use tools like [Webhook Tester](https://webhook-test.com/) for debugging.

## Validation and Testing
Before deployment, ensure the following:
1. The API key is valid and has sufficient quota.
2. The `Movie` variable captures user input correctly.
3. All variables (`Title`, `Year`, `Poster`) are saved and mapped without errors.
4. Dynamic content displays the movie information properly.

---

## Notes and Tips
> **Note:** Always secure your API key. Avoid exposing it in client-side environments.  
> **Tip:** Use fallback messages for cases where the movie is not found or the API request fails.

## Example: Full Flow
1. **User Input:**  
   User types "Shawshank Redemption".
2. **API Call:**  
   Fetch data from `http://www.omdbapi.com/?t=Shawshank%20Redemption&apikey=YOUR_API_KEY`.
3. **Response Variables:**  
   - `Title`: "The Shawshank Redemption"  
   - `Year`: "1994"  
   - `Poster`: *URL to movie poster*
4. **Dynamic Output:**  
   ```
   Found: The Shawshank Redemption (1994)
   ```

   *(Displays the poster image)*
