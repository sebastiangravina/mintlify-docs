The **Make.com** integration block allows you to trigger a scenario at a specific moment in your flow and return data to enhance automation.

## Steps to Trigger a Scenario

1. **Insert the Make.com block**  
   Place the Make.com block at the desired point in your flow where the scenario should be triggered.

2. **Set Up the Scenario in Make.com**  
   - Follow the instructions on [Make.com](https://www.make.com) to create and enable your scenario.  
   - Ensure the scenario is properly configured to receive incoming requests.

3. **Test the Scenario**  
   - Return to your flow on release0.com.  
   - Click on your Make.com block and select **"Test the request"**.  
   - This will trigger the scenario on Make.com for validation purposes.

## Returning Data from Make.com

To pass data back to your flow:  

1. **Add a "Webhook Response" Module**  
   At the end of your scenario in Make.com, include a "Webhook Response" module to send the desired data back.

2. **Validate the Data Flow**  
   Test your integration to ensure data is returned correctly and appears in your flow as expected.

> **Note**: Properly configure your Make.com scenario to handle requests and responses to avoid errors during testing or deployment.
