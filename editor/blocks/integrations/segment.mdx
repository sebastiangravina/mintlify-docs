### How to Configure the Segment Block

1. **Add the Segment Block**:  
   Drag and drop the Segment block into your flow.
2. **Configure the Block**:
   - Click on the Segment block to open the configuration panel.
   - Enter your **Write Key** in the designated field.
   - Select the desired action (Identify, Alias, Event, or Page).
   - Fill in the required parameters and any optional ones as needed.
3. **Test the Block**:
   - Use the **Test** button to send a test event to Segment.
   - Check the Segment dashboard to verify the event was received successfully.
   - You can use the [Segment Debugger](https://segment.com/docs/connections/sources/debugger/) to validate the events sent.

In the following example, we will configure the **Track** action to send user information to Segment.

- Create a new block group and collect user data (Name, Username, and Email).
- We can use a random variable to create a random userID.
- Add user input blocks to collect user data.
- Add the Segment block and select the **Track** action.
- Fill in the required parameters:
  - **User ID**: Use the variable that holds the random user ID.
  - **Email**: Use the variable that holds the user’s email address.

Once configured, the Segment block will send the user information to Segment using the **Identify** action.

When we run the scenario, the Segment block will send the user information to Segment using the **Track** action.
And once we check the Segment dashboard, we can see the event was received successfully.

If we check the source debugger, we can see the event details and the properties sent to Segment.
