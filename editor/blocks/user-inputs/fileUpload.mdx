The **Upload File** User Input Block allows users to upload files during their interaction. This block is highly flexible, supporting single or multiple file uploads, HTML placeholders, and configurable visibility settings.

## Configuration Steps

### 1. Allow Multiple Files
- Enable the **Allow multiple files?** option if you want users to upload more than one file.

### 2. Customize the Button Label
- Define the text for the upload button in the **Button label** field.  
- **Examples**:  
  - "Upload"  
  - "Submit Files"  

### 3. Save Uploaded URLs
- Use the **Save upload URLs in a variable** field to store the uploaded file URLs.  
- This ensures the file links are available for later use in your workflow.


## File Size Limit
- Each uploaded file has a fixed size limit of **10MB**.  
- For larger files:  
  - Instruct users to upload their files to a cloud storage service (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox).  
  - Use a **Text** Input Block to collect the shared links.

## Other ways to upload files

There is an alternative way to allow an agent to collect images or documents. For this you can use the **[Text user input block](./text)** and enable the **allow attachments* toggle within the block settings.
