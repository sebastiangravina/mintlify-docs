description: Add searchable dropdown input with auto-suggestion capability to help users choose from large datasets like countries, languages, or product lists.

The **Autocomplete** User Input Block allows users to select an item from a large predefined list by typing to filter suggestions. This is useful for selecting countries, cities, languages, brands, or any extensive dataset that would be cumbersome in a traditional dropdown.

## Key Features

- **Searchable Dropdown**:  
  - Users can type to dynamically search and filter available options.

- **Support for Large Lists**:  
  - Efficiently handles long item lists (e.g., 200+ countries) with performance optimization.

- **Key Value Pairs**:  
  - Each item can have a display name and a return value, allowing for flexible data handling.

## How It Works

1. The block renders a text input field.
2. As the user types, a dropdown appears with suggestions matching the input.
3. Users can select an item from the dropdown, which is then saved in a specified variable
4. The selected item can be used later in the flow for conditional logic or data processing.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Add the Autocomplete Input Block**:
   - Drag and drop the **Autocomplete** input block into your flow.
    <Frame style={{ maxWidth: '600px' }}>

    </Frame>
2. **Configure the Autocomplete Block**:
    - **Placeholder**: Set a prompt like "Start typing to search...".
    - **Button Label**: Customize the button text (e.g., "Search").
    - **Available Presets**: Choose from common datasets (e.g., countries, languages) or add your own items as key-value pairs.



## Configuration Options

- **Required field**: Make the input mandatory for submission.
- **Restrict to list only**: When enabled, users can only select from the provided suggestions. Custom entries will not be allowed.
- **Enable fuzzy search**: When enables, the search will match results even if the user's input contains typos or partial matches. This is useful for large datasets where exact matches are not always possible.
- **Placeholder**: Customizable prompt to guide users (e.g., "Start typing to search...").
- **Button label**: Customizable text for the search action button.
- **Available Pressets**: A provided list of common datasets (e.g., countries, languages, communication channels) for quick setup.
- **Items**: 
  - Define the list of items to be displayed in the dropdown.
  - Each item can have a `value` (e.g, FR) and `name` (e.g, France).
- **Max suggestions**: Limit the number of suggestions shown in the dropdown to improve performance and usability.
- **Minimun characters to search**: Set the minimum number of characters a user must type before suggestions appear. Helps to avoid irrelevant results for short inputs.
- **Save selected value to variable**: Store the selected item in a variable for later use in your flow. (e.g, France)
- **Save selected key to variable**: Optionally save the key of the selected item in a separate variable.(e.g, FR)

## Example Use Case

**Selecting a Country**:  
Let users pick a country by typing part of the name. The dropdown filters and suggests matches as they type.

- Prompt user: "What country are you from?"
- The user starts typing "Al" and suggestions like "Albania" and "Algeria will appear.
