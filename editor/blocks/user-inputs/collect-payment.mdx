The **Request Payment** User Input Block allows you to collect payments seamlessly within your workflow by integrating Stripe. This block supports various payment methods and allows customization for test or live environments.

## Setting Up Stripe Integration

### **1. Connect Stripe Account**
To use the **Request Payment** Input Block, you must first connect your Stripe account:
1. Click **Select an account** > **Connect new**.
2. In the popup configuration:
   - **Account Name**: Enter any name of your choice (does not need to match your Stripe account).
   - **Test Keys**:
     - Find your test keys here: [Stripe Test Keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys).
     - These keys are used for testing purposes during preview. You can use a test card to simulate payments.
     - Example test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242` with any future expiration date and any CVC.
     - The test keys (test mode) will be uised only when launching your workflow in preview mode. The published link will use the live keys.
   - **Live Keys**:
     - Find your live keys here: [Stripe Live Keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys).
     - These keys will be used for published workflows. Only the published link will use the live keys.
   
   
> **Note**: If you want to use **test keys** in a published agent, also enter them in the **live key** fields.

## Input Configuration

Once your Stripe account is connected, configure the Request Payment block:
1. **Price Amount**: Specify the amount to charge.
2. **Currency**: Select the currency (e.g., USD, EUR).
3. **Button Label**: Customize the button text (e.g., "Pay", "Checkout").
4. **Success Message**: Set a confirmation message for successful payments.

### Enabling Payment Methods

- Visit [Payment Methods Settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods).
- Enable methods such as:
  - Cards
  - Apple Pay
  - Google Pay
  - Alipay

### **2. Using Dynamic Pricing**
For workflows where the amount may vary:
- Link the **Price Amount** field to a variable or formula.
