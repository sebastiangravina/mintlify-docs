The **Address** User Input Block enhances user experience by allowing users to **autocomplete address inputs** using the **Google Maps API**. This is particularly useful for agents that need structured location data such as street addresses, cities, or postal codes.

## Key Features

- **Required field**: Ensures users provide a valid address before proceeding.
- **Restrict to list only**: When enabled, users can only select addresses suggested by Google Maps. Typing custom addresses will not be allowed and the block will prevent submission until a valid suggestion is selected.
- **Placeholder Text**: Customizable prompt to guide users (e.g., "Enter your address").
- **Include postal code**: When enabled, the postal code will be included in the address returned by Google Maps. This is useful if you need more accurate location data.
- **Language**: Selects the language used to fetch results from Google Maps.
- **Button label**: Customizable button text for the search action.
- **Save answers in Variable**: Save the selected address in your desired variable.

## How It Works

1. The block renders a text input powered by Google Places Autocomplete.
2. As the user types, location suggestions appear.
3. When the user selects a suggestion, the formatted address is saved in the specified variable.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Add the Address Input Block

- Drag and drop the **Address** input block into your flow.
- Configure the **Prompt** to ask users for their location (e.g., "Can you provide your address?").

### 2. Google Maps API Key

- This block requires a valid **Google Maps JavaScript API key**. We provide a limited number of free requests, but you will need to set up your own key for production use.
- Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/credentials) to generate an API key.
- Ensure your key has the **Places API** enabled.
- Add your key to the environment or agent settings under **Google Maps API Key**.

> **Note**: After changing your Google Maps API key, you need to wait for **5 minutes** for the changes to take effect.

### 3. Save Address to a Variable

- Assign a variable name to store the selected address.
- This variable will contain the full address string returned by Google.

## Example Configuration

- **Prompt**: `"Where should we send your delivery?"`
- **Variable**: `user_address`

Once selected, the variable `user_address` will store something like:  
`"742 West Evergreen Street, Springfield, Misuri, EE. UU."`

## Limitations
