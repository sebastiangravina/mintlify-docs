The **Date** User Input Block is used to collect date or date-time inputs from users. It allows flexibility in selecting a specific date, a range, or including time details.

## Key Features

- **Native Date Picker**:  
  - The input block uses the native date picker of the userâ€™s browser and device.  
  - The appearance varies depending on the platform. For example, on Firefox, it uses a standard native date input interface.

- **Customizable Date Format**:  
  - Customize the displayed and stored date format using the **date-fns** library.  
  - Supports a wide range of formatting tokens.

## Example Formats

Here are examples of commonly used date formats:

- `yyyy-MM-dd`: Example: `2025-01-02`  
- `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss`: Example: `2025-01-02 14:30:00`  
- `dd/MM/yy`: Example: `02/01/25`  
- `dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss`: Example: `02/01/2025 14:30:00`  
- `d.MM.yy`: Example: `2.01.25`

## How to Configure

**Set Date Input Type**:  
   - **Is Range?**: Allow users to select a start and end date.  
   - **With Time?**: Extend the input to include time (e.g., hours and minutes).

 **Define Date Format**:
   - Use the **Format** setting to apply your preferred format.  
   - Refer to the [date-fns format documentation](https://date-fns.org/docs/format) for additional tokens and examples.


##### Example Prompts

- "Please select your preferred appointment date."  
- "Choose a date range for your booking."  
- "Enter the date and time for the event (format: `dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm`)."

> **Note**: While you can specify how the date will be saved and handled in the system, the actual display format may vary based on the user's browser and device settings. Always test your date inputs across different platforms to ensure a consistent user experience. While you can specify a date format for example dd/MM/yyyy if the user's browser or device is configured to use a different date format for example MM/dd/yyyy, the user will see that format instead. The date will still be saved in the format you specified.
