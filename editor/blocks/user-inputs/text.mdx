## Key Features

### Short Text Input
- **Default Behavior**: The block is configured to expect short text answers by default.  
- **Use Case**: Suitable for concise responses, such as names, email addresses, or brief feedback.

### Long Text Input
- **Configuration**: Enable long text input in the block's settings.  
- **Use Case**: Ideal for detailed responses, such as descriptions, opinions, or open-ended questions.

### Password Type Input
- **Purpose**: Allows users to enter sensitive information securely, such as passwords. The text entered is masked (e.g., shown as dots) to protect user privacy.
- **Configuration**: Set the input type to "password" in the block settings.
- **Use Case**: Useful for scenarios where users need to provide confidential information, like account credentials or secure notes.

> **Note**: When using the password input type (or any other input types), you can define the variable in a way that it will not be stored in the results table, ensuring that sensitive information is not exposed. In order to do this just start the **variable name** with **secure_**. Any variables that start with this prefix will not be stored in the results table. For example `secure_password` will not be stored in the results table, but you can still use it in your flow logic.

### Allow Attachments
- **Purpose**: Lets users attach files (e.g., documents, images) to their responses.  
- **How It Works**:  
  - Attachments are uploaded, and a URL is generated for each file.  
  - The URL is stored in the variable defined in the block configuration.  
- **Use Case**: Useful for collecting supporting documents or images.

> **Note**: For this method to work make sure you add a **variable** in the **Save the URLs in a variable** option.

#### Allow Audio Clips
- **Purpose**: Adds a microphone button to the input field for users to record and send voice messages.  
- **File Format**:  
  - The recorded file is a WebM file if supported.  
  - If not (e.g., Safari), the file is in MP4 format.  
- **Use Case**: Perfect for scenarios where users prefer or need to respond via audio.

#### Example Use Cases

1. **Short Text Input**:  
   - "What is your name?"  
   - "Enter your email address."

2. **Long Text Input**:  
   - "Describe your experience with our product."  
   - "Provide any additional details about your request."

3. **Password Input**:
    - "Please enter your account password."  
    - "Set a new password for your account."

4. **Attachments**:  
   - "Please upload a copy of your resume."  
   - "Attach a photo of the issue."

5. **Audio Clips**:  
   - "Record and send us your feedback."  
   - "Describe the problem using voice notes."

## Considerations

- **Testing**: Ensure the block is configured correctly for the desired input type.  
- **Compatibility**: Confirm that attachment uploads and audio recordings are supported across user devices and browsers.  
- **Variable Storage**: Define and verify the variable for storing URLs of attachments or audio files.

By configuring the Text User Input Block appropriately, you can gather a wide variety of responses from your users effectively.
