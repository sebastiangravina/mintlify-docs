The **Buttons Choice** User Input Block allows you to present predefined options to your users. This block supports both single-choice and multiple-choice inputs and can dynamically display options based on variables.


## Key Features

### Single Choice
- Users can select one option from a list.  
- Each choice can be linked to a specific path in your flow for direct branching.  
- Use the **Default** path to handle cases where no specific path is linked to the selected option.

</Frame>

### Multiple Choice
- Allows users to select multiple options at once.  
- The selections can be saved in a variable for further processing or conditional responses.

### Dynamic Items
- Dynamically populate the list of options using a variable.  
- This feature is useful for displaying lists sourced from external data, such as Google Sheets or APIs.  
- Ensure the variable contains a list of values before using it in the block.

### Adding an "Other" Button
- Include an "Other" button to let users provide an answer that isn’t listed in the predefined options.  
- Connect the "Other" button to a [Text](/editor/blocks/user-inputs/text) Input Block to collect custom input.

## How to Configure

### Single Choice Example
1. Add a **Buttons Choice** Input Block.  
2. Define the options (e.g., "Option 1," "Option 2").  
3. Link each choice to a specific path in your flow.  
4. Set a **Default** path for fallback handling.

### Multiple Choice Example
1. Enable the **Multiple Choice** option.  
2. Define the list of options.  
3. Save the user’s selections in a variable for further use.  

### Dynamic Items Example
1. Populate a variable with a list of items (e.g., from Google Sheets).  
2. In the block configuration, select the variable containing the list.  
3. The options will be dynamically displayed to users.

### Adding an "Other" Button
1. Add an **Other** button to the list of predefined choices.  
2. Connect the "Other" button to a **Text** Input Block.  
3. Collect and process the user’s custom input.

### Different Replies Based on Multiple Choices
1. Save the user’s selections in a variable.  
2. Add a **Condition** Logic Block to check the value of the variable.  
3. Define different paths and responses based on the user’s selections.
