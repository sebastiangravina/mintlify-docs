The **URL** User Input Block is used to collect URL inputs from users. It validates whether the provided URL is properly formatted but does not verify its validity or accessibility.

## Key Features

- **URL Format Validation**: Ensures the user-provided input follows a correct URL format (e.g., `https://example.com`).  
- **Retry Message**: If the URL is improperly formatted, a retry message prompts the user to re-enter the correct URL.

## Limitations

- **No Validity Check**: The block does not verify if the URL points to an active or accessible website.  
- **Advanced Validation**: To check if the URL is valid or reachable, you need to use an **[HTTP Request Block](/editor/blocks/integrations/http-request)** to call a URL validation API.

## Example Usage

### Basic Configuration
Sample user prompt:  
"Please enter the URL of your website."

Behavior:  
- The block checks if the input is a validly formatted URL.  
- If the format is incorrect (e.g., missing `https://`), the user is prompted with a retry message.

##### Advanced Validation with HTTP Request Block

1. Add an **HTTP Request Block** after the URL Input Block.  
2. Configure the HTTP request to send the provided URL to a URL validation API.  
3. Process the API response to determine the next steps.

Example HTTP Request Configuration:  
- **API Endpoint**: `https://api.urlvalidation.com/validate?url={{website_variable}}`  
- **Method**: `GET`  
- **Variable**: Replace `{{website_variable}}` with the variable storing the user's URL.
