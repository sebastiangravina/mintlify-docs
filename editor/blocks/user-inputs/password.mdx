The **Password** User Input Block allows you to restrict access to parts of your agent flow by requiring users to enter a password. This is useful for protecting sensitive information or features within your chatbot. Unlike the Password Agent Restriction that compelatelty prevents unauthorized users from accessing the agent, this block allows you to control access to specific flows or information within the agent.

## Key Features
- **Required field**: Ensures users must enter a password to proceed.
- **Placeholder**: Customizable prompt to guide users (e.g., "Enter your password").
- **Retry message**: Customizable message displayed when the user enters an incorrect password.
- **Button label**: Customizable button text for the submission action.
- **Passwords**: You can set specific password(s) that users must enter to proceed.
- **Save selected passwords in Variable**: Save the entered password in a specified variable for further processing

## How It Works
1. The block renders a password input field.
2. Users must enter the correct password to proceed.
3. If the entered password matches one of the configured passwords, the flow continues.
4. If the password is incorrect, the user sees a retry message and can attempt to enter the password again.
5. The entered password can be saved in a variable for later use in the flow.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Add the Password Input Block**:
   - Drag and drop the **Password** input block into your flow.
   - Configure the **Prompt** to ask users for their password (e.g., "Please enter your password to continue").
