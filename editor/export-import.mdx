You can export and import full Agent flows to back up, duplicate, or share agentsâ€”even across different [workspaces](/workspace/general).

## Exporting an Agent Flow

1. Open the builder for the agent you want to export.
2. Click the **menu button** (three dots) in the top-right corner.
3. Select **Export** from the dropdown menu.
4. Save the file to your preferred location.

## Importing an Agent Flow

You can import an existing agent flow when creating a new agent. Follow these steps:

1. Go to the agent creation page.
2. Choose **Import a file**.
3. Upload the previously exported file.
4. Review the imported flow to ensure everything is correctly configured.

### Validation and Testing

Before deploying the imported agent, ensure:

- All flows are correctly mapped and functional.
- There are no missing or broken connections.
- The agent dialog performs as expected in test runs.

By following these steps, you can easily manage and reuse agent flows across different projects and [workspaces](/workspace/general).
