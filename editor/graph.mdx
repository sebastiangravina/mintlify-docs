The Graph is where you arrange your conversation flow and connect the Agent [blocks](./blocks/overview) together.
It provides a visual representation of how the conversation will progress, allowing you to see the connections between different blocks and how they interact with each other.

## Starting a Flow
It all begins with a **Start Block** block, which is the entry point of your flow. From there, you can add various blocks to create a dynamic and interactive conversation experience.

## Adding Blocks
You can then drag and drop blocks from the left sidebar directly onto the graph.
Connect blocks by clicking on the small circles at their edges. This creates a line that indicates the direction of the conversation flow.
To delete a block, select it and press the `Delete` key, or click the block and choose the `Delete` icon from the block menu.
You can move blocks by dragging them to new positions on the graph to reorganize your conversation flow as needed.
