The Graph is where you arrange your conversation flow and connect the Agent [elements](./elements/overview) together.
It provides a visual representation of how the conversation will progress, allowing you to see the connections between different elements and how they interact with each other.

## Starting a Flow
It all begins with a **Start element** element, which is the entry point of your flow. From there, you can add various elements to create a dynamic and interactive conversation experience.

## Adding elements
You can then drag and drop elements from the left sidebar directly onto the graph.
Connect elements by clicking on the small circles at their edges. This creates a line that indicates the direction of the conversation flow.
To delete a element, select it and press the `Delete` key, or click the element and choose the `Delete` icon from the element menu.
You can move elements by dragging them to new positions on the graph to reorganize your conversation flow as needed.
