The Graph is where you arrange your conversation flow and connect the Agent [blocks](./blocks/overview) together.
It provides a visual representation of how the conversation will progress, allowing you to see the connections between different blocks and how they interact with each other.

## Starting a Flow
It all begins with a **Start Block** block, which is the entry point of your flow. From there, you can add various blocks to create a dynamic and interactive conversation experience.

## Adding Blocks
You can then and drop blocks from the left sidebar directly onto the graph.
You can connect blocks by clicking on the small circles on the edges of the blocks. This will create a line that connects the two blocks, indicating the flow of the conversation.
You can also delete blocks by selecting them and pressing the `Delete` key on your keyboard. You can also click on the block and select `Delete` icon from the block menu.
You can also move blocks around by clicking and dragging them to a new location on the graph. This allows you to rearrange your conversation flow as needed.
