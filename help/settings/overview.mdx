## General

The general settings determine the overall behavior of your Agent.

### General Options
- **Prefill User Inputs**: Automatically pre-fills User Inputs when their associated variable has a value.
- **Hide Query Parameters on Start**: Hides query parameters when the Agent starts.
- **Remember User**: Ensures the Agent remembers user details across interactions.

## Typing Emulation

The Agent includes a typing emulation feature to simulate a human-like typing speed. While this provides a natural experience, itâ€™s important to balance speed for clarity and readability.

### Customizing Typing Emulation
- **Typing Speed**: Adjust the typing speed to fit your needs. Avoid making it too low, as the goal is not to mimic a real human.
- **Disable on First Message**: Disables typing emulation for the first message, reducing display time when the page initially loads.
- **Delay Between Messages**: Add a delay (up to 5 seconds) between messages. By default, this is set to 0 seconds.  
  *Tip*: For a one-time pause, use a `Wait` block between messages.

## Security

Restrict the execution of your Agent to specific origins to enhance security. This is particularly useful when embedding your Agent in a website to prevent unauthorized use.

### Example Configuration
To allow execution only on `https://my-company.com`, add this URL to the allowed origins.  
*Note*: If you exclude `https://release0.com`, your shareable Agent URL will no longer work.

## Metadata

### Features

- **Custom Head Code**: Add third-party scripts for advanced customization.

## Google Tag Manager (GTM)

Easily integrate a GTM container with your Agent for tracking and analytics.

### Configuration
- **Find Your GTM Container ID**: Go to your GTM dashboard, select the container, and locate the ID in the top-right corner.
- **Embedding Note**: Do not include GTM in the Agent if embedding it in an existing website. Instead, install GTM in the parent website.
