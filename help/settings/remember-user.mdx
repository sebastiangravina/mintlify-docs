In the **Settings** tab of your *Agent* on **release0.com**, you will find the *Remember User* setting under the **General** section. This feature allows you to retain the chat session state in the user's web browser storage. As a result, if a user interacts with the Agent, closes the chat, and reopens it later, the conversation will resume from where it left off.

## Storage Options

There are two storage methods available:

1. **Local Storage**:
   - Saves the chat state in the user's web browser.
   - The session will be accessible only on the same device and web browser.
   - Data persists even after the browser is closed but can be cleared manually or automatically based on browser settings.

2. **Session Storage**:
   - Saves the chat state in the user's web browser.
   - The session will be accessible only on the same device and web browser.
   - Data will be deleted as soon as the user closes the browser tab or the web browser.

## Important Notes

> **Note**: If you publish a new version of your *Agent*, any saved sessions will be automatically reset. This means that:
> - If a user has an ongoing session and refreshes the chat while a new version is deployed, the Agent will restart from the beginning.
