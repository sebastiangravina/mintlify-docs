## Roles in a Workspace

There are several roles users can have in a **release0.com** workspace:

- **Admins**: Manage workspace settings, delete a workspace, and manage other admins, members, and guests.  
- **Members**: Team members who can create and edit Agents but cannot edit workspace settings or add members.  
- **Guests**: External collaborators who can work on specific Agents but do not have workspace-wide access. Guests must be invited individually to specific Agents to view or edit them.

## How to Invite Admins and Members

1. Navigate to your workspace.  
2. Click the **Settings & Members** button and then go to the **Members** tab.  
3. You will see the **Workspace members list**:  

   - Here, you can invite new admins or members.
   - You can also assign admin roles to existing members.  

## How to Invite Guests

1. Open the specific Agent where you want to invite guests.  
2. Click the **Invite Users to Collaborate** button.  
3. You will see the **Guests List**, showing who has access to this particular Agent.  

### Guest Permissions

Guests can be assigned one of two permissions:  

- **View the Agent**: Guests can view the flow and results but cannot modify anything.  
- **Edit the Agent**: Guests can view and edit the flow and results.  

> **Note**: Guests are restricted to the specific Agents they are invited to and cannot access the entire workspace.
