## How to find my `AgentId`

If you'd like to execute the Agent in preview mode, you will need to provide the ID of the building Agent available in the editor URL:



## How to find my `publicId`

For published Agent execution, you need to provide the public Agent ID available here:



## How to find my `workspaceId`

In your workspace dashboard, head over to **Settings & Members > Workspace > Settings** and copy the workspace ID.

## How to handle stream

If you enabled streaming, whenever an AI message should be streamed, you will receive the following JSON response:

```json
{
  "messages": [],
  "clientSideActions": [
    {
      "type": "stream",
      "stream": true,
      "expectsDedicatedReply": true
    }
  ]
}
```

The bot is ready to accept the message streaming. You now need to send the following query:

```sh
curl -X POST https://release0.com/api/v2/sessions/{sessionId}/streamMessage
```

Where `{sessionId}` should be replaced by the session ID you got from the start chat response.

This endpoint will send Server-Sent events with all the information to display the streamed message.

Once it is done, you can continue the flow by sending a [continue chat request](./chat/continue-chat) with the streamed message as the message content.
```

> **Note**: Ensure that all IDs (e.g., `AgentId`, `publicId`, `workspaceId`) are correctly obtained and used to avoid errors in execution.
