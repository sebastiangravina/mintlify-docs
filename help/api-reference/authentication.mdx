title: 'Authentication'
---

Some API endpoints are protected and require authentication using an API token.

## Generate a token

1. Navigate to your agent dashboard (https://app.release0.com/agents).
2. Click on **Settings & Members > My account**.
3. Under the **"API tokens"** section, click on **"Create"**.
4. Provide a name for the token, then click on **"Create token"**.
5. Copy your token.


## Use your token

You can authenticate by adding an `Authorization` header to all your HTTP calls. The `Authorization` header should be formatted as follows: `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (replace `<token>` with the token you generated).

### Example:

```sh
curl -L -X GET 'https://app.release0.com/api/agents/:agentId/results' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer myAwesomeToken'
```

> **Note**: Replace `:agentId` with the specific Agent ID and `myAwesomeToken` with your API token.
