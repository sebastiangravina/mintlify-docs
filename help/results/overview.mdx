## Viewing Results

Once your **Agent** is published, you start collecting results from your users. These results are accessible in the **Results tab** of your Agent. 

### Partially Filled Results

You might notice some partially filled results in your data. This is **normal and expected**. Your **Agent** collects answers as soon as they are provided by the user, even if they don’t complete the entire conversation. 

> **Note**: Partially filled results help you understand where users drop off, offering opportunities to improve your Agent’s performance. This is one of **release0.com’s** greatest features.

## Features in the Results Tab

### Time Filter

By default, results from the last 7 days are displayed. You can adjust this by using the **date filter button**



### Export Results to CSV

You can export all results to a CSV file by clicking on the **Export** option. This generates a CSV file containing all the current results from your Agent.

- **Include Deleted Blocks**: If enabled, this will include answers from blocks that are no longer part of your Agent (e.g., removed in a previous version).

### Re-arrange and Hide Columns

To make your results table easier to read, you can:
- Re-arrange specific columns.
- Hide columns that are not relevant.


### Logs

For each result entry, there’s a **See logs** button. Clicking it reveals details about issues encountered during integrations, such as:
- **Send email**
- **Google Sheets**
- **Webhook calls**

### Validation and Testing

Before exporting or analyzing your results:
1. Ensure all data has been correctly collected.
2. Verify the **See logs** section for any integration errors.
3. Check the time filter to avoid missing important results.

> **Tip**: Use exported CSV files to perform further analysis in tools like Excel or Google Sheets for insights into user behavior.
