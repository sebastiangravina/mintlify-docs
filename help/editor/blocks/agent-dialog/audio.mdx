## Key Features

- **Upload Audio**: Add an audio file directly from your device.
- **Paste URL**: Use a URL to reference an audio file hosted online.

## Troubleshooting

### The First Audio Block Does Not Autoplay  
- This behavior is expected due to browser policies.  
- Most web browsers require the user to interact with the page (e.g., click or scroll) before audio can play automatically.

### Audio Not Playing  
- The issue is likely caused by a malformed audio file.  
- To resolve this:  
  - Ensure the audio file is correctly encoded.  
  - Test by downloading the file and playing it locally on your computer.  
  - Re-encode the file if necessary using an audio editing tool or converter.

## Supported Formats

- Common formats such as `.mp3`, `.wav`, and `.ogg` are widely supported.  
- Ensure compatibility with your users' devices and browsers.

## Example Usage

### Uploading an Audio File  
- Click the **Upload** button in the block configuration.  
- Select the desired audio file from your device.

### Pasting an Audio URL
