## Requirements

1. **Chatwoot Account**: Create an account on [Chatwoot](https://www.chatwoot.com).
2. **Website Inbox**: Set up a "Website" inbox in your Chatwoot account.

### Steps to Create a Website Inbox

3. Select "Website" as the type and complete the configuration.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Insert a Chatwoot Block

Place the **Chatwoot Block** in your **Agent Dialog** wherever you want the widget to be triggered.

### 2. Obtain Your Website Token

To locate your website token:

1. Go to your Chatwoot dashboard.
2. Navigate to **Inbox Settings** of your created Website Inbox.
3. Copy the **Website Token**.

### 3. Prefill User Information

You can use collected variables to prefill user information in Chatwoot by setting values in the **Set User Details** section.

- **Example**: If you set the `Email` input to `john@gmail.com`, Chatwoot will associate the email with the current user.

## Custom Attributes

Chatwoot supports custom attributes, which allow you to enhance user interactions. These attributes will be automatically filled by your **Agent Dialog**.

### Example: Result URL

You can link the current **Result URL** to the Chatwoot conversation by adding the following custom attribute:

- Applies to: Contact
- Display Name: Agent Result URL
- Key: Agent_result_url
- Description: Release0 result URL that points the user on Release0, before triggering the Chatwoot widget
- Type: Link

## Setting User Behavior

When prefilling user information, you can specify how the user ID is handled:

1. **Default Behavior**: If the `ID` input is left empty, Chatwoot will use either:
   - The user's `Email`.
   - The `Result ID` from your **Agent Dialog**.

2. **Avoid Duplicate Contacts**: Setting the `Email` as the `ID` ensures contacts are properly merged and prevents duplicates in Chatwoot.

### Validation and Testing

Before deploying the integration, ensure the following:

- The **Chatwoot Block** is correctly configured in your **Agent Dialog**.
- The **Website Token** is accurate and functional.
- Custom attributes, such as the `Result URL`, are correctly passed to Chatwoot.
- Prefilled user information appears correctly in the Chatwoot conversation.
