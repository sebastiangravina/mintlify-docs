The Google Sheets integration allows you to **inject**, **update**, or **retrieve data** from Google Spreadsheets. This powerful feature enables dynamic interactions with your data directly from your Agent.

## Requirements for Proper Functionality

To ensure smooth operation:
1. **Header Row**: The first row of your spreadsheet must serve as the header row.
2. **Unique Header Names**: Each column header must have a unique name. This allows the block to identify which column to update.

### Example Header Row

| Name       | Email                  | Phone   | Submission Date |
|------------|------------------------|---------|-----------------|
| Alice      | alice@example.com      |         | 08/01/2025      |
| Bob        | bob@example.com        |         | 08/01/2025      |

## Adding a Submission Date to a Row

To add a **submission date** to a row:
1. Create a new variable with the value `Now`. This variable will store the current date and time.
2. Use the **Google Sheets block** to update the `Submission Date` column using the `Now` variable.

## Advanced Concepts

### API Limitations

The Google Sheets API has the following rate limits:
- **60 Read Requests per Minute**
- **60 Write Requests per Minute**

> **Recommendation**: Minimize the number of Google Sheets blocks used in your Agent. If working with multiple sheets, aggregate the data into a single sheet first and interact with that aggregated sheet.

## Troubleshooting

If the Google Sheets block **fails to insert or update a row**, follow these steps:
1. **Check the Logs**: Ensure the block executed as expected.
2. **Validate Headers**: Confirm that your spreadsheet's headers are properly defined and unique.
3. **Review API Limits**: Verify that you have not exceeded Googleâ€™s API rate limits.
