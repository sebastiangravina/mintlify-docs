title: Meta Pixel
---

The **Meta Pixel** Integration Block allows you to seamlessly track user interactions and events by embedding a Meta Pixel into your Agent's flow. Here's how it works and how to configure it.

---

## **How the Pixel Block Works**

When a **Pixel Block** is added to your flow:

1. **Initialization**:  
   The Meta Pixel is initialized, and a `PageView` event is automatically tracked as soon as the page loads.
   
2. **Event Tracking**:  
   Specific events, such as a form submission or a button click, are tracked when the block is executed.

---

## **Configuration Steps**

### 1. **Adding the Pixel ID**
   - Enter your **Meta Pixel ID** (e.g., `73627907634`) into the input field in the configuration box.
   - This ID connects your Agent flow to your Meta Ads account for event tracking.

### 2. **Event Tracking**
   - Toggle the **"Track event"** option to enable event tracking.
   - Specify the event name (e.g., `Lead`) in the dropdown or input field. 
   - Optionally, click **Add parameter** to pass additional data (like user information) with the event.

### 3. **Collecting User Inputs**
   Use the **Collect** block (e.g., *Collect Name*) to gather data from the user. This data can be associated with the event being tracked.

## **Example Use Case**

### Flow Example:
| Step       | Description                                 |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Hi there!  | The Agent greets the user.                 |
| What's your name? | The Agent asks for the user's name.  |
| Collect Name | User inputs their name, which is stored.  |
| Track Lead  | Tracks the event "Lead" with user details. |

### Event Tracking:
In the example image:
- **Pixel ID**: `73627907634` is used.
- The `Lead` event is tracked whenever the block is executed.
- Optional parameters can include user data (e.g., `Name` or `Email`).

## **Best Practices**

- **Test Your Pixel**: Use the [Meta Events Manager](https://www.facebook.com/events_manager/) to ensure the Pixel is working and events are logged correctly.
- **Unique Event Names**: Use descriptive and unique event names to avoid confusion in tracking.
- **Add Parameters**: Include user data, such as `Name` or `Email`, to make your event tracking more insightful.
