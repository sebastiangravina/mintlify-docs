title: Send Email
---
The **Email** block allows you to send email notifications when specific events occur, such as a user completing your bot. You can also use it to send a recap email to the user.

## Configuring the Email Block

If you're on the **Free plan**, you need to configure your own SMTP account to send emails. This is a precaution against spam and abuse. Several SMTP providers offer free plans with generous limits. Here are some recommended options:

| **SMTP Provider** | **Free Tier Details**                                  |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| [**SendGrid**](https://sendgrid.com/)       | Up to 100 emails/day for free.                        |
| [**Mailgun**](https://www.mailgun.com/)     | 5,000 free emails for the first 3 months.             |
| [**Amazon SES**](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/) | Free for up to 62,000 emails/month (AWS free tier).   |
| [**Resend**](https://resend.com/)           | Offers a free tier for testing and low-volume usage.  |

If you're on a **Paid plan**, you can send emails directly from `notifications@release0.com` without any additional setup.

## Default Email Content

By default, the email sent contains a summary of the user's responses. For example:

> **Subject**: New Lead Notification  
> **Body**:  
> Your bot has collected a **new lead**! ðŸŽ‰  
>  
> **Name**: Jhon  
> **Email**: emial@Release0.com  
> **Company**: Release0  
> **Question**: I'm interested in your services. Can I have more info?  
>  
> [Check Results](#)

You can customize this content to include your own text or HTML for a fully branded email experience.

## Adding Attachments

You can include attachments in your email using the **Attachments** option. Ensure the attachments are linked to a **File Upload input block** in your flow.

## Troubleshooting

If you're not receiving the expected emails:
1. **Check the logs** in your dashboard for errors.
2. Verify that your SMTP credentials are configured correctly (for Free plan users).
3. Ensure the recipient email address is valid.
