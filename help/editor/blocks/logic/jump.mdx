The **Jump** block feature in this visual flow design allows you to redirect the conversation to a specific block elsewhere in the flow. This helps maintain a cleaner and more organized flowchart, especially in complex interactions where multiple pathways might converge or lead back to the same point.

### Key Features of the Jump Block
1. **Simplifies Flow Structure**:  
   Instead of creating duplicate blocks or drawing long, messy connections, you can reuse existing blocks by jumping to them.

2. **Efficient Flow Design**:  
   - Reduces redundancy by avoiding repeated blocks.  
   - Helps centralize logic, making future edits easier.

3. **Flexibility**:  
   Allows dynamic redirection to key blocks, such as a **Menu**, **FAQ**, or **Restart**.

### Example Use Case: Jumping to the "Menu"
- **Scenario**:  
  After completing a specific action (e.g., submission confirmation), you want the user to return to the main menu without duplicating it in the flow.  

- **Implementation**:  
  Add a Jump block in the current sequence, select the "Menu" block as the destination, and the conversation will seamlessly redirect there.
