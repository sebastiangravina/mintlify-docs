The **Redirect** logic block allows you to redirect your user to a specified URL, with the option to open it in the current tab or in a new tab.

## Key Features
- **Flexible URL Redirection**: Easily direct users to a predefined URL.
- **Tab Options**: Choose to open the URL in:
  - The **current tab**.
  - A **new tab**.

## Important Notes
> **Note**: On Safari and iOS devices, redirects to a new tab are blocked by default. In such cases, a popup will be displayed to the user instead. 

### Testing Recommendations
- Ensure you test the **Redirect** logic block on Safari and iOS devices to verify functionality.
- Confirm the desired behavior (current tab or new tab) works as intended across various browsers.
