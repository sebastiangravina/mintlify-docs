The **Webhook** Block allows you to pause a conversation while waiting for an external system to call back a specified webhook URL. This is particularly useful for handling **long-running processes**, such as background tasks or external API requests, that may take time to complete.

---

### **Key Features of the Webhook Block**
1. **Pauses Conversation**: 
   The bot waits for an external webhook response, ensuring the user doesnâ€™t proceed until the external process is complete.
   
2. **Environment-Specific URLs**:
   - **Test URLs** for debugging and testing.
   - **Production URLs** for live environments.

3. **Authentication**:
   The webhook must be authenticated for security. See **[API authentication](/help/api-reference/authentication)** details for implementation.

---

### **Webhook URLs**

#### **Test Environment**:
Use these URLs to test your webhook integration:  

- **Web**:  
  ```text
  https://release0.com/api/v1/agents/{agentId}/blocks/{blockId}/web/executeTestWebhook
  ```
  
- **WhatsApp**:  
  ```text
  https://release0.com/api/v1/agents/{agentId}/blocks/{blockId}/whatsapp/{phone}/executeTestWebhook
  ```
  - Replace `{phone}` with the formatted phone number (e.g., `58456737811` for `+58 456 737811`).  
  - Ensure there are **no spaces** or **plus signs**.

#### **Production Environment**:
The production webhook URL is the same for all environments:  
```text
https://release0.com/api/v1/agents/{agentId}/blocks/{blockId}/results/{resultId}/executeWebhook
```
- Replace `{resultId}` with the current **user result ID**.
- To get the **result ID**, use a [Set Variable](/help/editor/blocks/logic/set-variable) with the **Result ID** value in the flow.

### **How to Use the Webhook Block**
1. **Add the Webhook Block**:
   - Insert the Webhook block at the appropriate point in your flow where the conversation needs to pause.

2. **Specify the Webhook URL**:
   - Use the provided test or production URL, substituting placeholders (`{agentId}`, `{blockId}`, `{resultId}`, etc.) with your actual values.

3. **Handle Authentication**:
   - Ensure the webhook is authenticated before triggering any requests. Refer to the **API authentication** documentation for setup.

4. **Trigger External Process**:
   - Upon reaching the Webhook block, the bot sends the request and waits for the external system to call the webhook URL to resume the conversation.

5. **Resume Flow**:
   - Once the webhook is called successfully, the bot resumes the conversation with the user.

### **Use Cases**
- **Long-Running Background Tasks**:  
  Example: Processing a database query or generating a report.
  
- **Third-Party Integrations**:  
  Example: Waiting for a payment gateway to confirm a transaction.

- **Real-Time Updates**:  
  Example: Waiting for an IoT device to complete an action or return data.


#### **Test Webhook Call**:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://release0.com/api/v1/agents/{agentId}/blocks/{blockId}/web/executeTestWebhook" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
-d '{"status": "success", "message": "Process completed"}'
```

#### **Production Webhook Call**:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://release0.com/api/v1/agents/{agentId}/blocks/{blockId}/results/{resultId}/executeWebhook" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
-d '{"status": "success", "message": "Process completed"}'
```
