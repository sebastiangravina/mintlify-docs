The **Link to Agent** Logic Block allows you to seamlessly transition from one Agent dialog flow to another. This feature ensures that your workflows remain clean, modular, and reusable in various contexts.

## Key Features

### Share Variables Between Agents

The **Link to Agent** Logic Block automatically shares variable values between linked Agents. If the linked Agent contains variables with the same names, they are pre-filled with the values collected from the first Agent.

- **Example**:
  1. The first Agent asks the user for their name and stores it in the variable `Name`.
  2. The linked Agent displays the `Name` variable in a response.
  - **Outcome**: The user's name collected in the first Agent is displayed in the second Agent dialog.

### Merge Answers

The **Merge Answers** option allows you to combine the answers gathered from the linked Agent with those collected in the current Agent. This feature is particularly useful for:

- Sending all collected data to a third-party app in a single request.
- Compiling responses into a unified results table.

- **Example**:
  1. The first Agent collects basic information (e.g., name, email).
  2. The linked Agent gathers additional details (e.g., preferences, feedback).
  3. All answers are combined and processed as a single dataset.

## Benefits

- **Modularity**: Create reusable Agent flows for common tasks, reducing duplication.
- **Streamlined Data Handling**: Automatically share and merge variables between linked Agents.
- **Enhanced Workflow Management**: Maintain clean, organized flows without unnecessary complexity.

> **Note**: Ensure variable names are consistent across Agents to fully utilize the pre-fill and merging features.

### Validation and Testing

Before deploying your linked logic block, confirm the following:

1. Variable sharing works as expected, with no mismatched or missing data.
2. The **Merge Answers** feature combines data correctly across Agents.
3. The linked Agent flow is reusable and functions seamlessly within various contexts.
