# Blocks

Blocks are the **atomic building blocks** of an Agent dialog. You can chain any blocks together to create **complex conversation flows**. When you drag and drop a block in the Agent flow, by default, it will be inserted into a **group** that can have a title. Blocks are always contained within groups.

There are multiple block categories to make it easier to find the right block for your needs:

### User Input Blocks
User Input blocks are used to **ask the user for input**. These blocks will pause the conversation and wait for the user to provide input.

### Logic Blocks
Logic blocks are used to **perform background operations**. These blocks are not visible to users but are essential for managing complex flows.

### Integration  Blocks
Integration blocks are used to **trigger external service operations**.

### Ai Blocks
Ai blocks are used to ** integrate with AI systems** like Chat-GPT, Anthropic, Mistral AI, etc.  AI-powered chatbots can interpret complex user queries, understand context, and provide human-like responses.
