## Configuration Steps

### 1. Allow Multiple Files
- Enable the **Allow multiple files?** option if you want users to upload more than one file.

### 2. Customize the Button Label
- Define the text for the upload button in the **Button label** field.  
- **Examples**:  
  - "Upload"  
  - "Submit Files"  

### 3. Save Uploaded URLs
- Use the **Save upload URLs in a variable** field to store the uploaded file URLs.  
- This ensures the file links are available for later use in your workflow.

## File Size Limit
- Each uploaded file has a fixed size limit of **10MB**.

  - Instruct users to upload their files to a cloud storage service (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox).  
  - Use a **Text** Input Block to collect the shared links.

## File Visibility Settings

### Visibility Options

1. **Public**:  
   - Generates publicly accessible URLs for uploaded files.  
   - Use this option if files need to be integrated with other blocks, such as **Send Email** or **Webhooks**.

2. **Private**:  
   - Files are only accessible when logged into your account.  
   - **Note**: Private file URLs cannot be used in other blocks, such as email attachments.

3. **Auto (Default)**:  
   - Files are **public** if uploaded via the web runtime.  
   - Files are **private** if uploaded via the WhatsApp runtime.
