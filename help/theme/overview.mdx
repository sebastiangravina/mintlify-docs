The **Theme** section allows you to customize the appearance of your Agent.

## Global

This section enables you to:
- Enable or disable the Agent branding.
- Change the font used by your Agent.
- Customize the background of your Agent.

## Chat

This section allows you to personalize all chat components, including:
- Avatars
- Agent Dialogs
- User Inputs

### Customizing the Avatar
To change the avatar image:
1. Click on the bot avatar within the **Chat** section.
2. Upload or select a new image.

## Custom CSS

For advanced customization, you can add your own CSS styles.

### Inspecting Elements for Custom CSS
1. Navigate to the **Theme** page.
2. Right-click on the bot or the specific element you want to modify.
3. Select **Inspect** to view and target the element's CSS.

### Example: Rounded Buttons with Gradient Colors
To create buttons with rounded corners and a gradient color, add the following CSS:

```css
.typebot-button {
  border-radius: 40px;
  background-image: linear-gradient(to right, #e052a0, #f15c41);
  border: none;
}
```

### Example: Customize a Single Button's Color
You can customize the color of an individual button by targeting its `data-itemid` attribute. For instance:

```css
[data-itemid='cl3iunm4p000f2e6gfr8cznnn'] {
  background-color: gray;
  border-color: gray;
}
```

#### Finding the Button's `data-itemid`
1. Right-click on the button you want to customize.
2. Select **Inspect** to view the `data-itemid` attribute in the HTML.

> **Note**: Always test your customizations in a staging environment before applying them to your live Agent.
