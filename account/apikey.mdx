To create a new API key, click on the **Create API Key** button. This will open a modal where you can enter the name of the API key. Once you have entered the information, click on the **Create API Key** button to create the API key.

This will generate a new API key that you can use to authenticate your requests to the API. You can copy the API key and use it in your application.
