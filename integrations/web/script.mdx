## Overview

The **script embed option** is useful in scenarios where you **donâ€™t have access** to the HTML tree of your application or if your website builder only permits inline script snippets. 

### When to Use
- When access to the HTML structure is restricted.
- When using website builders with limited customization options.

### Recommendation
Whenever possible, prefer the **[HTML & JavaScript embed instructions](./libraries/html-javascript)** over the script embed method. Script snippets are merely scripts that inject code from the HTML & JavaScript embed method, offering limited control and customization.

### Example: Script Embed Snippet

Below is an example of how a script embed snippet might look:

```html
<script>
  (function(d, s, id) {
    var js, scriptTag = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];
    if (d.getElementById(id)) return;
    js = d.createElement(s);
    js.id = id;
    js.src = "https://your-custom-url.com/embed.js";
    scriptTag.parentNode.insertBefore(js, scriptTag);
  }(document, 'script', 'your-custom-script-id'));
</script>
```

> **Note**: Replace `https://your-custom-url.com/embed.js` with the actual URL of the script you want to embed.

### Validation and Testing

Before deploying, ensure:
- The script is embedded correctly and is functional.
- The `id` in the script is unique to prevent conflicts.
- The script does not interfere with other parts of the application.

### Additional Notes

- Always test the snippet in a staging environment before deploying it to production.
- Ensure compliance with any performance or security requirements of your website.
