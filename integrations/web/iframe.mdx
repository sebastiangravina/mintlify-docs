## Embedding an agent with Iframe

You can easily obtain your agent iframe code by clicking on the **“Iframe”** button within the **“Share”** tab of your Agent configuration.

### Iframe Preview

When setting up the iframe, you can configure its **width** and **height** to suit your needs. A recommended default configuration is:

- **Width**: `100%`  
- **Height**: `600px`  

This ensures a responsive and user-friendly display.

### Example Iframe Code

```html
<iframe 
  src="https://r0.ar/your-slug/your-agent" 
  width="100%" 
  height="600" 
  frameborder="0" 
  allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
```

> **Note**: Replace `https://r0.ar/your-slug/your-agent` with the specific URL of your agent.

### Validation and Testing

Before deploying your iframe, ensure the following:

1. The URL used in the `src` attribute is correct.
2. The iframe displays as expected across devices.
3. The height and width are set appropriately for your use case.

For further customization, refer to the agent documentation on [release0.com](https://docs.release0.com/).
