2. Generate the initialization snippet from the **Share** tab of your agent.

## Agent Settings

### Embedding Options

1. **Generate Initialization Snippet**:  
   - Go to the **Share** tab of your agent.
   - Click on the **WordPress** button to configure the embed code.

2. **Embedding Modes**:
   - **Standard Container**: Paste the shortcode anywhere on your site.
   - **Popup or agent Dialog**: Use the following format:
     ```javascript
     agent.initPopup({
       agent: "customer-support-copy-eOgcOzw",
       autoShowDelay: 0,
     });
     ```

> **Note**: You can customize this snippet from the **Share** tab of your agent.

### Excluded Pages

To exclude the a from specific pages, provide a comma-separated list of page paths.

#### Examples:
| Path             | Exclusion Behavior                                                |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/app/*`         | Excludes all pages starting with `/app/`.                         |
| `/app`           | Excludes only the `/app` page.                                   |
| `/app?param=1`   | Excludes `/app` only when the query parameter is set to `1`.      |
| `/app?param=*`   | Excludes `/app` with any `param` query value.                     |
| `/app/*?param=*` | Excludes all `/app/` pages with any `param` query value.          |

### Personalizing the User Experience

Enhance user experience by injecting WordPress-specific variables directly into your agent.  

#### Steps:
1. Use the WordPress plugin for release0.com.
2. Declare variables in your agent with **exact syntax**.  
   - Example: For `WP Email`, ensure the variable is spelled as `WP Email` (case-sensitive).

> **Note**: Incorrect syntax, such as `wp Email` or `WP email`, will not work.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Fixes

#### LiteSpeed Cache Issues
1. **Localize Resources**:
   - Remove the URL `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net` from LiteSpeed’s "Localize Resources" list.
2. **JS Exclusion**:
   - Add `web.js` and `agent` to the **JS Excludes** and **JS Deferred Excludes** fields in LiteSpeed's **Tuning Settings**.

#### WP Rocket Cache Plugin
1. Navigate to **Settings > WP Rocket > Excluded Inline JavaScript**.
2. Add the term `agent`.
3. Save changes.

#### Script Defer Issues
- If a plugin adds the `defer` attribute to external scripts, add an exception for `agent` in the plugin's configuration.
