### Trigger an agent Command on Button Click

You can trigger an agent command (like opening a popup) when a button is clicked. Here's how:

1. Assign a unique ID to your button:
   - Navigate to the **Settings** tab of the button in Webflow.
   - Add a dedicated ID to the button element.

2. Update your embed code:
   - In the existing `<script>` tag of your agent Embed element, insert the following code:

   ```javascript
   document.getElementById('BUTTON_ID').addEventListener('click', (event) => {
     event.preventDefault();
     Agent.open();
   });
   ```

3. For multiple buttons, repeat the process:
   - Add more button IDs and associate them with the same or different commands. Your code might look like this:

   ```javascript
   <script type="module">
     import Agent from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@release0.com/js@1.1.0/dist/web.js';

     Agent.initPopup({
       agent: 'my-agent',
     });

     document.getElementById('BUTTON_ID_1').addEventListener('click', (event) => {
       event.preventDefault();
       Agent.open();
     });

     document.getElementById('BUTTON_ID_2').addEventListener('click', (event) => {
       event.preventDefault();
       Agent.open();
     });
   </script>
   ```

   > **Note**: Replace `BUTTON_ID_1` and `BUTTON_ID_2` with the actual IDs assigned to your buttons.

## Example Use Case

In this example, clicking the specified buttons will open the agent popup. However, you can replace `Agent.open()` with any other command supported by the [Java library commands](/deploy/web/libraries/html-javascript#commands).

---

## Validation and Testing

Before deploying, ensure:
- All button IDs match those specified in the script.
- The JavaScript code does not contain syntax errors.
- The agent popup works as expected when the buttons are clicked.
