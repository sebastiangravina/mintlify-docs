To get the appropriate instructions to deploy your **agent** on your platform of choice, head over to the **Integrations** tab of your **flow editor** and select the platform you want to deploy your **agent** on.

You can choose to embed your **agent** in three different ways:

## 1. Standard Embed
Embeds the **agent dialog** in a box with the size of your choice anywhere on your app. This is the method used on the release0.com homepage:

- You can set the width to `100%` and the height to `100%` to make it take up the entire page dimensions.

## 2. Popup Embed
Embeds the **agent dialog** in a popup overlaying your website. It can be triggered in multiple ways, such as:
- Automatically after a delay.
- When a user clicks a specific button.

## 3. Chat Bubble Embed
Embeds the **agent dialog** as a "chat bubble" at the bottom right corner of your site. This method allows for:
- Automatic triggering.
- Manual activation by user interaction.
- Displaying a “proactive message” to engage users.

> **Note**: For each option, follow the detailed steps and customization instructions available in the **Integrations** tab of your agent **flow editor**.

### Validation and Testing
Before deployment, ensure:
- The embed type works as expected on your platform.
- Dimensions and triggers are correctly configured.
- Proactive messages or delays are functioning as intended.
