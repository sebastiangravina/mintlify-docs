description: "Learn how to execute Release0 agents via HTTP requests for integration with external services."
---

Your **Agent** can also be executed with HTTP requests. This is useful if you want to integrate your **Agent** with another service or use it in a different programming language.

## Test

1. All your requests need to be authenticated with an API token. [See instructions](/api-reference/authentication).
2. To start the chat, send a POST request to `https://release0.com/api/v1/agents/<Agent ID>/preview/startChat`.  
   The first response will contain a `sessionId` that you will need for subsequent requests.
3. To send replies, send POST requests to `https://release0.com/api/v1/sessions/<session ID>/continueChat`  
   Use the following JSON body:

   ```json
   {
     "message": "This is my reply"
   }
   ```

   Check out the [Start preview chat API reference](../../api-reference/chat/start-preview-chat) for more information.

## Live
