## Communication Strategy

We believe in **clarity, empowerment, and speed**. Here’s how we approach support:

### 1. Start with the Docs → It’s faster!
Check [docs.release0.com](https://docs.release0.com) before writing to us. Most questions are answered instantly.

> ⚡ “You’ll often solve it in minutes — no need to wait your turn.”

### 2. Support = second step  
> If it’s not in the docs or something’s broken, reach out. We're ready.

### 3. Shared efficiency = better help  
> “Self-service first lets us prioritize complex issues faster — including yours.”


### Example: How to Get Help Efficiently

**First, check the official documentation**  
[docs.release0.com](https://docs.release0.com) — tutorials and walkthroughs for most common questions.

**Then check the platform status**  
[status.release0.com](https://status.release0.com) — real-time platform and integration status.  
→ No need to open a ticket if it’s already reported there.

**Still stuck?**
