# Release0 Support Guidelines

Welcome to Release0 support. This document outlines the scope of our support services and clarifies when requests require a consulting engagement.

### 2. How-To Guidance

## What’s Outside Support Scope

Some requests fall outside standard support due to their complexity or custom nature. These include:

- Designing agents or entire conversational flows from scratch
- Creating or maintaining custom APIs or webhook logic
- Debugging third-party services not managed by Release0
- Conversion copywriting or UX optimization
- Producing help guides or manuals tailored to your business
- Advanced analytics interpretation or campaign strategy

---

## When It Becomes Consulting

If your request requires:

- Over 30 minutes of deep troubleshooting or implementation
- Custom logic design and flow architecture
- Complex API mapping or third-party integrations
- Producing documentation, guides, or technical walkthroughs
- Training sessions or onboarding for your team

...then it qualifies as a **consulting or turn-key service**.

You’ll be referred to our **Solutions Team** or an official **Release0 Partner**, with consulting fees based on project scope.
