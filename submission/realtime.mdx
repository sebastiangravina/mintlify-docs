## Overview

On any given day, we track upwards of 100,000 Agent events at Release0. These events are ingested into our data warehouse, which is then materialized in a comprehensive, real-time analytics dashboard that gives you powerful insights into your Agent performance. 

While this is great, it is still an aggregated view of your data. What if you want to see a chronological stream of Agent events and export them for further analysis? This is where Release0's Real-time Events feature comes in. Release0's Real-time Events Stream is a detailed, real-time stream of events across your entire Release0 workspace.

To access your real-time events stream, navigate to the **Realtime** section in your workspace side menu.
