## Viewing Results

Once your **Agent** is published, you start collecting results from your users. These results are accessible in the workspace view by clicking the context menu next to your agent name.

</Frame>

 
 Your Agent results can also be accessed under the **Submission tab** of your Agent flow editor. 

 <Frame style={{ maxWidth: '800px' }}>
  <img src="/images/submission/ " alt="Submissions" />
</Frame>

There is also a quick overview summary of the submissions located on the **workspace** view inside the **Agent** card.

 <Frame style={{ maxWidth: '400px' }}>
  <img src="/images/submission/agent-card-detail.png" alt="Submissions Summary" />
</Frame>

In this quick view you can see the conversation **Starts**, this refers to each time the agent is started with at least one user interaction. Also it shows the total number of **Submissions** or number of users that have completed the agent conversation flow. Lastly it shows the last update of the agent configuration.


### Partially Filled Results

You might notice some partially filled results in your data. This is **normal and expected**. Your **Agent** collects answers as soon as they are provided by the user, even if they don’t complete the entire conversation. 

> **Note**: Partially filled results help you understand where users drop off, offering opportunities to improve your Agent’s performance. This is one of **release0.com’s** greatest features and it is explained in more detail in the [Analytics](/submission/analytics) section.

## Features in the Results Tab

### Time Filter

By default, results from the last 7 days are displayed. You can adjust this by using the **date filter button** located at the top right corner of the submission table.

### Export Results to CSV

You can export all results to a CSV file by clicking on the **Export** option. This generates a CSV file containing all the current results from your Agent.

 <Frame style={{ maxWidth: '250px' }}>

</Frame>

**Include Deleted Blocks**: If enabled, this will include answers from blocks that are no longer part of your Agent (e.g., removed in a previous version).

### Re-arrange and Hide Columns

To make your results table easier to read, you can:
- Re-arrange specific columns.
- Hide columns that are not relevant.

> **Tip**: Use exported CSV files to perform further analysis in tools like Excel or Google Sheets for insights into user behavior.
