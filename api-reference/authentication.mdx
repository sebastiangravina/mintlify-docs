Some API endpoints are protected and require authentication using an API token.

## Generate a token

1. Navigate to your agent dashboard (https://release0.com/agents).
2. **Access your API Keys**  
   Navigate to your **Account Settings** located at the bottom left corner of the dashboard.
3. **Create a new API Key**  
   - Click the **Create API Key** button.  
   - A modal will appear where you can input a name for your key (e.g., `Make.com Integration`).  
   - After naming your key, click **Create API Key** to generate it.

## Use your token

You can authenticate by adding an `Authorization` header to all your HTTP calls. The `Authorization` header should be formatted as follows: `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (replace `<token>` with the token you generated).

### Example:

```sh
curl -L -X GET 'https://release0.com/api/agents/:agentId/results' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer myAwesomeToken'
```

> **Note**: Replace `:agentId` with the specific Agent ID and `myAwesomeToken` with your API token.
