Whenever you're creating an Agent for marketing purposes, support or lead generation, it is important to use a custom domain for better brand recognition.

At **Release0** we offer our own short link domain like **'r0.ar'**, **'release0.ar'** for your agents for free. However, you can also use your own custom domain for your agents. Check out our [pricing page](https://release0.com/pricing) for details about custom domian limits per plan.

## Prerequisites

1. A Release0 Workspace. If you don't have one, you can create one for free.
2. A custom domain that you own. If you don't have one, you can purchase one from a domain registrar like [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/), [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/), or [Google Squarespace](https://domains.squarespace.com/).
3. Access to your domain registrar's DNS settings.


## Step 1 Add a Custom Domain

1. Go to the **Settings** menu in your workspace.
2. Click on **Domains**.

  <img src="/images/workspace/domains/add-domain.png" alt="Add new domain" />
</Frame>
3. Click on **Add Domain** button

<Frame style={{ maxWidth: '600px' }}>
  <img src="/images/workspace/domains/domain-name.png" alt="Add domain name" />
</Frame>

4. Enter your custom domain name in the *Your domain** field and click **Add Domain**.




## Step 2 Configure your domain

After adding your domain, you will see a new domian in the entry list, click on the config gear and you'll be presented with a DNS record that you'll need to add to your domain's DNS settings.

<Frame style={{ maxWidth: '800px' }}>
  <img src="/images/workspace/domains/dns-settings.png" alt="DNS settings" />
</Frame>

Use the information provided to add a new A record or CNAME record to your domain registrar's DNS settings. The CNAME record should point to the provided value.

## Step 2a: Adding an Apex Domain

If you're adding an apex domain (e.g. `example.com`), you'll need to add an **A record** with the following values:

```plaintext
Name: @ (or leave it blank)
Value: 76.76.21.21
TTL: 86400 (or the highest value possible)
```

## Step 2b: Adding a Subdomain

If you're adding a subdomain (e.g. `my-agent.mycompany.com`), you'll need to add a **CNAME record** with the following values:

```plaintext
Name: my-agent (or whatever subdomain you want to use)
Value: cname.release0.com
TTL: 86400 (or the highest value possible)
```

> **Note:** We do not support using `www.` as a subdomain, since the `www.` subdomain will always redirect to the apex domain instead.

### Recommended Subdomain Variations

We recommend using the following variations for your subdomains:

- `agent.example.com`
- `support.example.com`
- `nps.example.com`
- `salesbot.example.com`
