## Workspace Overview

Everything you do in an **Release0** takes place in a workspace. A workspace is like a home. It includes members, which could be just you, your team, or the entire company.

Your plan is tied to your workspace. For example, if you have a **Business plan** workspace and create a new one, the new workspace will default to a **Hobby** plan.

You can create as many workspaces as you want but you can only have  **2 Hobby** (free) workspaces at a given time.

Most of the workspace settings can be accessed by selecting the workspace name  fomr the dropdown in the top left corner of the dashboard. and then selecting **Settings**.

## Workspace Name

This is the name of your workspace. You can change it at any time. The name of the workspace is used to identify it in the dropdown menu. It allows a maximum of 32 characters.

## Workspace Slug

It's your workspace unique slug on Release0. It is used to identify your workspace in the flow URL and they are also used as part of your agent public URL. 

The slug is automatically generated when you create a new workspace, but you can change it at any time.
The slug must be unique and can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. It cannot contain spaces or special characters.

The slug is used to access your workspace in the URL. For example, if your workspace slug is `my-slug`, you can access it at `https://r0.ar/my-slug/my-agent`.

It is important to know that if you change the slug, the URL of your agents will also change. For example, if you change the slug from `my-slug` to `my-new-slug`, the URL of your agents will change from `https://r0.ar/my-slug/my-agent` to `https://r0.ar/my-new-slug/my-agent`.

> **Note:** If you are bringing your own custom domain, your agent link do not use a **[workspace slug](/workspace/general#workspace-slug)**. The slug is only used for the domains provided by Release0 (e.g. `release0.ar/your-slug/agent`).

## Workspace Logo

This is the logo of your workspace. You can upload a new logo at any time. The logo is used to identify your workspace in the dropdown menu and in the URL. It is also used in the email notifications sent to your members.

## Workspace ID

It is a unique internal identifier for your workspace. It is used to identify your workspace in the database and in the API. You can find it in the **Settings** tab of your workspace.

## Delete Workspace

Use this option to permanently delete your workspace. This action is **irreversible** and all data associated with the workspace will be **lost**, including agents, members, and settings. This action cannot be undone so be careful when using it.


## Workspace Credentials

**Workspace Credentials** are used to securely connect Release0 agents with external services, such as APIs or third-party platforms.

When you create a new credential in your agent, it is automatically stored as a *workspace-level credential*. This means:

- It is shared across all agents in the workspace.
- All workspace members can use it in their flows.
- You only need to manage the credential in one place.

**Note**: These credentials are isolated per workspace and never shared across organizations.

To add a new credential click on the **Add Credential** button, select the name of the service from the dropdown list and fill in the required information.

## Tags

Tags are used to categorize your agents within a workspace. You can add multiple tags to your agents to help you organize and search for them. please see the [Tags section](/workspace/tags) of the documentation for more details.
