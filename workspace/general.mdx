## Workspace Overview

Everything you do in an **Release0** takes place in a workspace. A workspace is like a home. It includes members, which could be just you, your team, or the entire company.

Your plan is tied to your workspace. For example, if you have a **Business plan** workspace and create a new one, the new workspace will default to a **Hobby** plan.

You can create as many workspaces as you want but you can only have  **2 Hobby** (free) workspaces at a given time.

Most of the workspace settings can be accessed by selecting the workspace name  fomr the dropdown in the top left corner of the dashboard. and then selecting **Settings**.
