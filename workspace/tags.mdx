Tags are used to categorize your agents within a workspace. You can add multiple tags to your agents to help you organize and search for them.

### What is a Tag?
A tag is a label that you can assign to an agent. Tags are color-coded and can be created and assigned to an agent in just a few clicks.

With tags, you can:

- Organize your agents by campaigns, clients, or any other categories you can think of.
- Filter your agents by tags and get a shareable link to the filtered results.
- Filter your [analytics](/submission/analytics) by tags to see how your agents are performing.

### How to create a Tag?

There are two ways to create a tag:

From the Workspace settings: Navigate to the workspace settings page in your workspace and select the tags tab. Click on the **Create Tag** button and enter the tag name and color. You can Also edit and delete tags from this page.
